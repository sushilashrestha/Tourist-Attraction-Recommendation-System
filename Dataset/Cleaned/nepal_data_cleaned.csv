4,Thupten Monastery ,"Thupten Choling Monastery is the well-known lama Trulsik Rinpoche fled from Rongbuk Gompa in Tibet to the Khumbu region during the Chinese invasion of Tibet in 1959, followed by a significant group of followers, including anis (nuns) and monks. He spent several years residing at Chiwong and other monasteries while aspiring to return to Tibet. Finally, in 1968, Rinpoche constructed Thupten Choling on donated property close to Junbesi. The monastery needed to be carefully constructed because it started to fall apart in the 1990s. After everything, he saw the location as a temporary retreat and continued to assume that he and his followers would be able to return to the homeland. However, when Chinese dominance over Tibet grew stronger and Buddhist leaders were forbidden from leaving, Rinpoche decided to establish a permanent residence at Thupten Choling in 2001.
The demolition of the ancient structures and ceremonial preparation for the new foundation marked the beginning of Thupten Choling's reconstruction. The friends of Trulsik Rinpoche provided generous financial support from Switzerland to help construct the new monastery, which Michael Schmitz planned. Mr. Schmitz and Helen Cawley, including the architecture, supply chains, and medical services, have overseen all aspects of the project. The rebuilding of the Thupten Choling monastery officially began in the year 2001.
Currently, several hundred Buddhist nuns and monks (80% of them being Tibetan refugees) live in the Thupten Choling monastery. As dozens of newcomers join the monasteries community each year, the population of the monastery only flourishes day by day.
However, the massive earthquake in April 2015 wrecked the beautiful infrastructure. This disaster caused severe damage to the ancient structures. During the rainy seasons, the monastery residents were compelled to live in tents because some of the walls had cracks in them.
The monks had requested financial assistance from Western organizations. The monastery has recently undergone a lot of necessary repairs and modernization, using solar energy for power consumption, electric cooktops for using it in the kitchen, etc.",86.5492821112275,27.6061600721939, Religious Site,Nepal
5,Bhadrakali Temple,"
Bhadrakali Temple in Kathmandu
Bhadrakali is one of the powerful goddess of Nepal. Located near the Sahid Gate at the eastern side of Tudikhel is the temple of Bhadrakali. Also known as Shree Lumadhi Bhadrakali, the temple is considered as one of the most renowned  Shaktipith  of Nepal. A form of Goddess Kali, Bhadrakali in Sanskrit means  blessed, auspicious, beautiful and prosperous  and she is also known as  Gentle Kali . Another mane for the goddess is Lazzapith.The ancient writings in the Vayu Purana and Mahabharat explain the creation of Bhdrakali by Devi s wrath when Daksha insulted Lord Shiva during the great Ashvamedha Yagya (Horse Sacrifice). Tantra Rahasya mentions her rising from the north face of Lord Shiva, (Uttaramnaya Amnayas) which is blue in color and has three eyes.

She is often believed to take on a terrible aspect that is represented with three eyes and four, twelve or eighteen hands carrying a number of weapons with flames flowing from her head and a small tusk sticking out from her mouth.

According to the myths, a farmer used to plough some nearby land and kept his food (bread) on the side. The bread used to turn into gold so the temple got its name as Lumarhi/Lumdi Devi s temple as Lumdi in Newari means  golden bread .
It was built in the year 1817 and was previously known as  Mudule Thumpko . The temple is believed to be built after Goddess Bhadrakali told the priest to dig the hill where they found the statue of the goddess. Since then, the temple lies there and is protected by Nepal Army. It overlooks the Singha Durbar, Prime Ministerial office, on the eastern side.

According to another legend, a tantric practitioner named Saswat Bajra went to Kamaru Kamachya in India and worshipped Shri Bhadrakali. The goddess was happy with him and came to Nepal with him in a holy water pot (a Kalash). He went to run some errands hanging it on a tree at Jamal on the northern side of Rani Pokhari. But Kalika took the form of a small girl and walked away. A farmer met her on his way to the field and questioned her but she fell asleep at the same spot and he went away. He could not find her when he returned but saw Kalika s incarnation instead. Then, Saswat Bajra also saw the goddess and the place was established as the temple of Bhadrakali.

King Ratna Malla started the Astamatrika and Bhadrakali dance together which takes place every twelve years. Also on April 10th, there is a Bhairav Bhadrakali Jatra every year. People come to the temple with the hope of getting their wishes fulfilled. Often marriage ceremonies take place here and also the families sometimes use it as the picnic spot. Maximum number of devotees throngs to temple during Dashain and Ghode Jatra.

Amidst the chaos of the center of the Kathmandu city, one can definitely experience peace of mind at the courtyard of Bhadrakali temple.",85.3168548457325,27.6992766284371, Religious Site,Nepal

The Nepal Architecture Archive (NAA), officially founded in 2016, is housed on the sprawling premises of the Taragaon Museum. This growing and versatile archive with rare photographs, books, surveys, blueprints, objects, and invaluable notes serves as readings of Nepal's fast-changing urban landscapes and cultural nuances. Documented over the years by numerous international and local visiting scholars and artists, the archive houses collected and donated material by over a hundred contributors whose research maps histories of varied architectural elements and materials for future understanding and documentation.
Niels Gutschow curated a collection of works by architects, anthropologists, artists, cartographers, engineers, photographers, planners, researchers, and advisors to the government for public viewing across the seven buildings of Carl Pruscha's Taragaon Hostel, converted into the Taragaon Museum in 2014.

The earlier exhibition display focused on academically highlighting photographs, etchings, maps, plans, and drawings. Taking a cue from these elements, this show of the permanent collection of NAA aims to open up access to a broader audience who will, over time, become the keepers and future contributors of the archive and the conveners of their museum, and their histories and futures at Taragaon Next.",85.3561748564243,27.7201965231151, Art Gallery,Nepal

15,Gupteshwor Mahadev,"History of the Gupteshwor Mahadev Cave

The cave was allegedly discovered in the 16th century by some local men who stumbled upon it when clearing some grass. Within the dark cave they discovered many shrines and statues dedicated to Shiva and other Hindu deities. These included Mahadev and Parvati, Nageswor and Saraswati. Towards the read of the cave the men discover that a waterfall ran through it. Further inspection revealed to them that the water fall came from Patale Chhango (later known as: Davis falls).

Outside the Gupteshwor Mahadev Cave

Before you even enter into the cave itself there are things to see. After walking through the roadside archway you ll have a dozen or so souvenir stalls to peruse. Though you will probably be better off buying in Lakeside or better yet Kathmandu. Before the ticket counter is a a round concrete balcony of sorts. It gives you a close look at the cave entrance and the statues leading up to it. After you buy you ticket you will will enter down the large spiral staircase. It s here where you ll see many modern statues and plaster works depicting everything from semi-clad ladies to bearded men and Nepali deities. There seems to be a take on some of the Kathmandu Valley s erotic carvings here as many of the sculptures are of a sensual nature.

Inside the Gupteshwor Mahadev Cave

As you enter the cave you ll discover how dark it is inside. There is lighting but it s only a series of small light bulbs. A head torch comes in handy as you descend a little to the first unusual sight. A cow shed. While primarily a religious site, the cow is a statue over a Shiva lingam. It s being developed more as a tourist attraction these days.You are free to enter inside the small little tunnel like shed. If you leave a donation you can receive a drink of milk. Though you might have to ask for it too. There is no live cow. Continuing on the 40 or so meters down the cave passing other small statues and shrines you ll come across the main Shiva temple which has a strict rule about no photography. There are guards or caretakers watching out for this. Continue on past the temple to the second part of the cave which is about 140 meters in length. Here the walls open up and you can see some nice colors in the cave walls. Further again and you ll come across a metal staircase leading downwards. You ll hear the waterfall ahead from here. This part is often closed during the monsoon season. Do be careful as the staircase and ground is quite slippery. Once you have descended the staircase you will have to walk across some uneven rocky ground until you get to an area with a view of the waterfall.",83.9572321996093,28.1894282515503, Religious Site,Nepal

The king thought of keeping this beautiful idol in his own home as the beauty of the fierceful idol was too mesmerizing. The king was returning to his hometown after the marriage ceremony. The bride, groom and others from the marriage procession took shelter in the forest and slept there in the night. On the following day when they woke up in the morning there was a ruckus around them. Not a single person was able to move the idol from that step. So the King Pratap Narayan Singh Malla ordered to build the temple for the goddess in the exact same spot where the goddess had taken rest. The temple was renovated in the late 1990s with other construction of other temples such as the temple of Lord Shiva, Radha Krishna and Laxmi Narayan.",83.6135626025498,28.2554199192709, Religious Site,Nepal
27,Kalika Bhagwati Temple,"
High a top the southern shores of the Kali Gandaki River in western Nepal, nestled amidst the bustling town of B glung, stands the majestic Kalika Bhagawati Temple. Dedicated to the fierce Hindu goddess Kali, consort of Shiva and embodiment of female power, this sacred site reigns as a major destination for pilgrims and enthusiasts alike.
Within the expansive courtyard, accessed through four grand entrances facing the cardinal directions, lies a vibrant tapestry of devotion. Smaller temples dedicated to deities like Shiva, Radha Krishna, and Lakshmi Narayan stand alongside the central shrine, offering a diverse spiritual landscape for visitors. The air buzzes with fervent chants and rituals, culminating in the grand festivals of Chaite-Dashain and Dashain, where thousands flock to pay their respects and seek blessings from the divine.
Legend whispers of the temple's origins, tracing them back to a royal dowry gifted by King Manimukunda Sen to his son-in-law, Pratap Narayan Singh Malla. The idol, imbued with divine power, refused to be moved after a storm-wracked night, leaving the king no choice but to build a sanctuary around it, the very site that now pulsates with spiritual energy.
While tradition once saw animal sacrifices performed within the temple grounds, a shift towards compassion has prevailed. In 2016, the sacrificial practice of pigeons was replaced by their symbolic release, a testament to the temple's embrace of a gentler, more peaceful form of devotion. Whether seeking spiritual solace, admiring architectural splendor, or simply basking in the vibrant atmosphere, the Kalika Bhagawati Temple stands as a beacon of faith and cultural richness in the heart of Nepal.

121,Shree Krishna Pranami Mandir ,"Pranami Dharma propagates monotheism. i.e. belief in one Supreme Power, Namely Poorna Brahma Sacchidanand (Satchidanand)Parmatma. The informal foundation of Pranami Dharma was laid during the Braj and Raas Leela (Krishna Leela) in Dwapar,r approximately 5000 years ago in this ephemeral world. It considers Shri Krishna of Braj and Raas leela as an embodiment of Poornabrahm Parmatma or the Supreme Lord. It was founded by Nijanand Swami Acharya Shri Devchandra ji. Hence, the religion first started as Nijanand Sampradaya and later came to be known as Shri Krishna Pranami Dharma. Nijanand also means   Nij (Self) Anand (Bliss)- Bliss of the Self. Our scripture is Tartam Sagar which is also known as Swaroop Saheb, and is a Book of REVELATIONS. It was revealed through Mahamati Prannath approximately 350-400 years ago. Mahamati Prannath ji, was the disciple of Shri Devchandra ji and He is responsible for propagation of its philosophy across Indian Subcontinent. The philosophy helps in a clear demarcation of Self (atma/soul), Overself (par-atma), Supreme Self or Supreme Lord (Parmatma) in the ethereal world and of ego, mind and body in the ephemeral world and goes on to describe the relationship between them. It helps in understanding not only how but also why - the reason- the universe and world was created. Sundarsath (as the followers of Pranami Dharma are called) follow the path of love as is between a Lover and the Beloved. This is only possible if a person is able to rise above the bodily existence and can dwell on the level of spirit/soul while remaining in the ephemeral existence. The philosophy helps in making sense of the various deities, demi-Gods and Goddesses as are expressed in Philosophy of Sanatan Dharma. It expounds on the essence of various religious scriptures of the west and goes on to show that the diversity between them is unwanted. In essence all religions talk about the Same Lord Supreme, but are called by different names. It clearly answers the following questions   Who am I? Where am I from? What is my purpose of being in this world? Who is my origin? What is the relationship with my Origin? The Sundarsath greet each other using the word Pranam, meaning I bow to the spirit in you which is the embodiment of Supreme Lord, Sat-Chid-Anand meaning Truth-Consciousness-Bliss. Any one, who can love One Lord Supreme as a Beloved, is actually following the path of a Pranami, even though, one is not aware of one s relationship with the Lord Supreme. If one gains the knowledge one has with the Lord Supreme, the ease with which one can attain Him is unparalleled. The sundarsath follow a concept of an Asht-prahar (asht-eight//prahar-consists of 3hours) seva pooja (love permeated prayer) to keep a constant awareness of the nearness to and relationship with Lord Almighty around the clock.",85.3758359514177,27.7131551223417, Religious Site,Nepal

As such, the square remains the traditional heart of the old town and Kathmandu s most spectacular legacy of traditional architecture. The square bore the brunt of Kathmandu's 2015 earthquake damage. Half a dozen temples collapsed, as did several towers in the Hanuman Dhoka palace complex, but it's still a fabulous complex. Reconstruction will continue for years.
Although most of the square dates from the 17th and 18th centuries (many of the original buildings are much older), a great deal of rebuilding happened after the great earthquake of 1934. The entire square was designated a Unesco World Heritage Site in 1979.

The Durbar Sq area is actually made up of three loosely linked squares. To the south is the open Basantapur Sq area, a former royal elephant stables that now houses souvenir stalls and off which runs Freak St. The main Durbar Sq area is to the west.

196,Jaya Bageshwori Temple,"A miracle at the Bageshwori temple - In 1926 ( Nepali calendar 1983) Padma Kumari Devi Singh (11 yrs) who lived in Kailash Bhawan, Gharbari Tole road (Ward-2), Nepalgunj, went to pray at the Bageshwori temple as on that day she was very sad. The temple was empty and even the 'Bajes' (Brahmins) were not to be seen. She sat at the single open door of the temple closed her eyes and prayed. When she opened her eyes she saw a small child, very poor (like a beggar child) in a long ragged garment standing before her. The child said 'lah' (in nepali lah means take) and put something in Padma's palm and closed it.
When Padma opened her hand there was nothing there and when she looked up, the child had disappeared. The incident had occurred in a matter of a second. It was with the blessings of the Goddess Bageshwori that the very next day Thakur Ananda Swarup Singh (father of Padma Kumari Devi) received a proposal for her marriage which he accepted and in 1930 at Singha Durbar,Kathmandu, Padma Kumari Devi was married to Maj-Gen. Mahabir S. J. B. Rana son of Late Shri Col. Maharajkumar Prakash S. J. B. Rana (who was the maker of the Junge Mahadev temple at Nepalgunj) and grandson of Cdg. Gen. Shri Tin Maharaj Sir Bhim Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana, Maharaj of Lamjanj and Kaski, who was Prime Minister of Nepal. Since then the number of visitors in the temple has increased at a very high rate.

200,Batuk Bhairav Temple ,"Batuk Bhairabh Temple is a one storey pagoda style temple topped with a brass roof at the crossroad in Lagankhel, the heart of Patan district. Unlike other temples, this one doesn t have an idol rather a stone-shrine is worshipped as Bhairabh accompanied by Lord Ganesh, Lord Kumar and Goddess Kumari in the inner sanctum. Many believe that Batuk Bhairabh is a family deity of God Minnath. According to the legend, King Amshuvarma of Lichhavi Period built this temple after his return from Prayag visit between 595 CE   621 CE, then Juddha Shumsher Rana refurbished it in 1912 B.S.

Lord Shiva divined himself as wrathful Bhairabh to scare off Brahma and Bishnu when a dispute on who is the greatest of all erupted between these three gods. It is believed that Shiva cut off one of five heads of Brahma when he counter-argued that Brahma was the greatest for being the Creator. According to the ancient text Shakti Sangam from Kali Khanda scripture, Batuk Bhairav was born to kill the demon Aapad who gained a powerful boon from Brahma. Aapad misused his powers to create havoc in all three worlds; heaven, hell and earth. Infuriated Gods to punish the demon for his misdeeds created a five year old boy with their combined powers. The boy was Batuk Bhairabh, the living embodiment of time and space. Aapad couldn t be killed in present, past or future time zones because of his boon, so Batuk momentarily paused the Kalachakra (time), ripped Aapad s body apart and saved the entire living creature.


People worship Batuk Bhairabh to get rid of Sani Dosh, the obstacles created by the planet Saturn. Weak Saturn results in insomnia, laziness, and many physical, mental and psychological losses and not only to oneself but to immediate family members too. In easier terms, life and lifestyle go down south because of Sani Dosh. Worshipping Batuk Bhairabh on a specific day of a week for a specific number of days will help one alleviate their problems. People also feed black dogs, Bhairabh s animal form on Saturdays as a service to Him.",85.3242168389261,27.6645321392273, Religious Site,Nepal
201,Rato Machchhindranath Mandir,"The Rato Machhendranath Temple is located in a huge courtyard known as Ta Baha, about 400 meters south of Patan s (Lalitpur s) Darbar Square.

It was built in 1673 on the foundations of earlier temples that had stood here since the 15th century. The temple is a towering Newar-style pagoda with three layers of declining roofs in its physical structure. Sheet metal (possibly copper) covers the roof surfaces, which are supported by 20 struts on the first and second levels, and twelve struts on the upper level. Avalokitevara is shown in a variety of stances on each of the 52 struts, typically with one or more extra sets of arms. There are miniature vignettes depicting scenarios from Buddhist hells, such as boiling alive, on the bottom registers of the struts, beneath Avalokitevara s feet. Other vignettes are of a gentler tone, with lesser deities supporting Avalokitevara on pedestals. The front-facing side (here, the north) is adorned with a huge variety of pots and pans mounted to tables, seemingly defying gravity, as is the case with many Newar pagodas. A lengthy pataka strip hangs from the temple s top to practically ground level in front of it, allowing Machhendranath/Avalokitevara to descend to earth.",85.3228765726089,27.6703403488174, Religious Site,Nepal

208,Ugrachandi Mandir,"The charming Ugrachandi Mandir, which is also known as Tamakhdyah, lies in the local tole of Patan. This square, four-storey temple with a hip roof made of flat sheets has an air of mystery. The first recorded mention of the temple is from 1702 CE, but its true age is not known. 

Inside, the temple houses the fierce goddess Ugrachandi, the mother deity of the Tamrakar clan. Hence, this gives the temple its Newar name, Tamakahdyah which means  the goddess of Tamkrakars . According to legend, she was brought from Kathmandu to Patan through tantric magic. 

The goddess is still revered in this modern age. Despite holding its ancient religious values, many physical changes have been added to this ancient site. In 1756 and 1761 a beautiful wooden torana was added to the temple. Today, an iconic stone under a copper torana in the sanctum represents Ugrachandi exuding divine peace.

The divinity of this temple is kept alive by various rituals and worship. A Newar Upadhyaya Brahmin conducts daily rituals, supported by the Tamrakar community. Various Tamkrakar Guthi (local Newari communities) involve themselves by sponsoring different religious events at this temple.

Among these events, key activities of the shrine include the regular Ugrachandi worship. This occurs between the full moon of the month Baishakh and the sixth day of the brighter half of the month Jestha. Here also occurs the grand Tahguthi Puha with animal sacrifice and a community feast. 
These vibrant rituals and ceremonies breathe life into the temple, making it not just a structure of stone and wood but a living symbol of the Tamrakar people's faith and culture.

The name  golden temple  came about through tourism and a shortening of it s translation more than it actually being made of pure gold.

When asked what about the Golden Temple appeals to them, a foreign couple said,  We are fascinated by the architecture of this closed courtyard Buddhist monastery which is unique. The carvings have a lot of detail. And, it is so peaceful. This three-roof monastery was built in the 12th Century by King Bhaskar Verma and is adorned with a golden facade, four large gateways, a clock tower, and two lion sculptures. The main priest here is only twelve years old, replaced after a month of service. The place is a serene getaway from the hustle and bustle of the busy Patan alleys.

225,Hasapota Ganesh Mandir,"Housed along the road from Jhamiskhel to Bakundol, the Hasapota Ganesh Temple stands as a beacon of devotion and history. This sacred shrine, established during the illustrious Malla era, venerates Ganesh as one of the principal deities of the Newars. With its statue facing the west, it symbolizes an ancient connection to the spiritual and temporal realms.

The chronicles of its renovation are meticulously inscribed on the right side of the temple. You will find inscriptions recounting restorations from the years 2001 B.S. and 2033 B.S. The temple's current incarnation owes its existence to the Hasapota Ganesh Dharmik Byabasta Samiti, who rebuilt it with reverence in 2075 B.S.

A myth whispers through the ages, telling of a saint from Lhasa who meditated deeply at this site, dreaming of constructing the ""Hasapota Palace."" His untimely death left his vision unfulfilled, but his devotion transformed the place into a revered sanctuary known as ""Lhasa Hasapota."" Over time, this name evolved, giving the temple its current identity. This tale hints at a historical reverence among Buddhists, adding a rich layer to its spiritual tapestry.

Remnants of the Lichchhavi era still linger in the temple's precincts. Here idols of Nawadurga and a sacred Shiva Linga find their home. Behind the temple, an artistic Sattal structure stands as a testament to the architectural beauty of the past. On the right, a complex dedicated to religious bhajans invites devotees to lose themselves in melodic worship.

Among the many rituals and festivals celebrated here, the Dipankar Yatra stands out. The festival is primarily a part of Hiranyabarna Mahabihar. However, it weaves together the vibrant tapestry of the culture of both Hiranyabarna Mahabihar and Hasapota Ganesh Temple.

This temple, steeped in myth and history, stands as a symbol of unwavering devotion, a bridge between the past and present. It is a sacred space where the divine continues to inspire and uplift all who enter its hallowed grounds.

228,Bhimsen Mandir Bhinddyolakshi,"At the northern edge of Patan Durbar Square, the stunning three-tiered Bhimsen Mandir Bhinddyolakshi temple rises majestically. Its grandeur is emphasized by a singular rectangular base. Two stone lions stand guard at the entrance, symbols of strength and protection. On the western wall, a beautiful colonnaded opening and a door await those seeking divine blessings.

Lalitpur, famed for its fine arts, houses four main Bhimsen temples. Among these Bhimsen temples, the Bhinddyolakshi temple is considered the oldest one.  Each has its own story and importance, reflecting the lasting devotion to this revered deity.  

Along with its religious significance, the temple also reflects the fine artistry of the Newars. The surface view of the temple in itself is quite grand and easy to notice. However, inside the temple. various shrines of revered deities can be found. When you enter the temple, a stone staircase ascends towards a sanctum where Bhimasena's statue stands. Nearby, statues of Draupadi, Bhairava, and Kali add vibrancy to the temple's ambiance.

Most of the temple's origin s history remains veiled in mystery. Yet, some documentation tells of its reconstruction in 1682 by Shrinivas Malla, rising from the ashes of a fierce fire. Through tremors in 1934 and 1967, it endured a lot of damage yet stood resilient. Despite the scars of the 2015 quake, its doors reopened in 2022 after reconstruction in its ancient form.

252,Tilaurakot,"It was in the ancient city of Kapilavastu that Prince Siddhartha was raised from his birth until the age of 29. This was the capital of the ancient Sakya Kingdom, where the prince was treated to a lavish life of luxury   a way of life that he would ultimately reject to begin his spiritual journey.

When he was 29 years old, Prince Siddhartha left through the eastern gate of Kapilavastu, to start the path to enlightenment as Buddha. Today, you can stand in this exact same spot and look out through the gate, onto the green fields that saw the first steps of this epic journey. This moment has become an important part of modern spiritual journeys.

The remains of the ancient capital are in modern-day Tilaurakot and much of them have been excavated and restored, while archaeological work is still taking place to uncover even more parts of the city and insights into the life of Siddhartha Gautama.

As a major civic centre from about the 9th century BC until the 3rd century AD, there would once have been many grand buildings here. Already, experts have uncovered palace structures, temples, roads and ponds. Some of the artefacts that have been found during excavations are on display at the nearby Kapilavastu Museum.
Tilaurakot is also an important site for Hinduism and you ll notice a rustic modern Hindu temple dedicated to the deity Samai Mai within the ancient walls, where people regularly come to worship.
As you walk through the site at Tilaurakot, you ll get a sense of the scale of the city where Buddha grew up   but you ll also appreciate how isolated he was here, protected by his father. It s not hard to imagine how, as a young prince, he would have looked beyond the walls of Kapilavastu and felt there was something deeper that he needed to uncover.

266,Nepal Folk Musical Instrument Museum,"The founder of the museum, Kadel is not a musician himself but a genuine admirer of the musical traditions. His dedication to his passion has driven him to keep up with his collection and sustain the cultural heritage. The museum now showcases 655 distinct Nepali folk musical instruments among more than 1350 from all over the country. The impressive fact about this museum is that all the musical instruments are either bought or newly made by the local artisans. No instrument is taken from any place where artists still play them. Only those, which are not in use are brought and kept in the museum. That way, the local artists can continue playing live music, keeping up the vibrance of the melodies. 
Folk music is not much in practice these days, which makes it a priority to save them. If it is forgotten, it is not just the music that we lose; we lose our culture, we lose our history. The folk musical instruments are simple, made from whatever is found from the surrounding. Inspired by the sound of nature: the waterfalls, blowing of the wind, mooning of cattle, chirping of birds, even the shape of the instruments is influenced by the nature. The Hiti Manga, for instance, is a fine replica of the water spouts in Kathmandu, producing music similar to the sound of water filled in a pot from the spout.
