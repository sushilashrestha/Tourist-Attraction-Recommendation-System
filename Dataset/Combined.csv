0,Shree Vishwokarma Agam Chhen,"Shree Vishwakarma Agam Chhen, located at Tuchimala tole of Bhaktapur is one of Bhaktapur’s most distinctive architectural structures. After building the Nyatapola temple, the Awal people are reported to have built the Agam Chhen.
The most unusual aspect of its building is that, unlike any other wooden window, it has a window constructed of clay. That window is also known as Tellikata jhyal, which translates to “clay window.”
The architecture is said to be 318 years old, which corresponds to the age of the Nyatapola temple.
Furthermore, the architecture was recently rebuilt and launched. This is the second time it has been renovated. It is reported that it was initially renovated after the 1990 earthquake.
However, there appear to be planning to showcase it as one of Bhaktapur’s museums.",85.4306298,27.6738883,Heritage Site,Nepal
1,Aadipadma Mahavihar,"Aadipadma Mahavihar is one of Bhaktapur’s oldest Vihars. Despite the lack of documentation detailing its origins, it is commonly referred to as Bhaktapur’s Jetho Vihar, which means “older one.” The vihar was referred to as Tombaha or Tungbaha in Rajbamsawali.
This Mahavihar is the place where both the Panchara (Pancha dan) and Samyak Mahadan begin. During Mohani, a kumari is also set up in front of this Vihar. All of this just demonstrates the location’s antiquity and historical significance.
Moreover, during Panchadan, all five Dipankar buddhas are welcomed at Aadipadma Mahaihar after gathering at Suryamandhi’s dabali (platform). Only after which, does the panchadan procedure begin.
The Vihar is located in Suryamadhi’s Taulachhen tole. Suryamadhi’s south-western corner has a short alley that leads directly to the vihar.",85.4352705,27.6733111,Heritage Site,Nepal
2,Lokeshwor temple of Bhaktapur,"Bhaktapur’s Lokeshwor temple, also known as Karunamaya, is a gorgeous temple located within the municipal limits of Bhaktapur. The temple is surrounded by local homes, moreover, the temple’s backside is rather attached to a house too.
Legend has it that when Lichhavi King Narendra Deva was ready to introduce Rato Machhindranatha (Lord Karunamaya) to Nepal, it was determined to establish one of the three designated locations. The contemporary Lokeshwor temple, Silu Mahadeva (Phasidegal), and Aankha Bahal were those three locations.
These locations are claimed to have been picked by a bird who was thought to be Lord Karunamaya’s emissary. The entire procedure was carried out under the auspices of tantrism.
As a result, these sites were regarded as the holiest. When the task of establishing Karunamaya was not completed, Baladeva, King Narendra Deva’s son, established a Padmapani Lokeshwor there.
Padmapani Lokeshwor is a Hindu god who appears to always be holding a lotus in his palm. He is also known as the Lashkar dyo (Laska dyo) and Bhaktapur’s Karunamaya.
The Jet Varna vihar is another name for it. It has Gaju Chaityas, Khamba Chaityas, Bajra Khatu Chaityas, Dharma Khatu, Vimba, Lokeshwor, and Dharma Dhatu Mandir on its premises.

3,Indra Varna Mahavihar (Inabaha),"Indra Varna Mahavihar locally called Inabaha and Indra Varta Mahavihar is one of the important Mahavihar of Bhaktapur. It is assumed that in N.S.741 when King Jagarjyoti Malla was ruling over Nepalmandal, Devsingha Buddhacharya bought land from Hari in Badimangal Yugtole and made the Vihar.
In the names of the erectors, Dev Singh, Jaya Singha and Melu Singha’s names come first. And the very same Devsingha also established a statue of Dipankar Buddha in N.S.749 in the name of his son Devadas.
There is also the image of Pragyaparamita and Avalokiteshwora on the right and the left side of the main deity, Achhobhya Buddha.
The vihar is also famous for a certain event named Barhe Chukegu. It is a part of the traditional Buddhist Chudakarma ritual where the boys of Bajracharyas and Shakyas go through Acharya Abhisheka. The event is more likely considered as a Tantric in grace rite that qualifies any Bajarcharya to become a priest.
During Gunla, daily bhajans (singing hymns ) are regulated there.
However, the torans of the vihar is in bizarre conditions. There are no images of the replicated deity in it. Besides, the architecture of the vihar also seems devastated by the 2015 earthquake. Even though there are people living there.
Indra Varna Mahavihar (Inabaha)
Nevertheless, the temple-like architecture at the top of the building with two Pattas (Patah) hanging around it gives quite a traditional taste. Also, the wall paintings are abnormally beautiful.",85.4341177,27.6723734,Heritage Site,Nepal
4,Mangal Dharmadweep Mahavihar (Jhaur Bahi),"Mangal Dharmadweep Mahavihar, which is located in Bhaktapur’s Golmadhi tole, is also known as Jhaur Bahi. In this Vihar, one of the five Dipankar Buddhas can be found.
Mangal Dharmadweep Mahavihar (Jhaur Bahi)
The Pauva arts are displayed here at Gunhi Punhi. This Vihar was constructed in the 13th century. Later, Jibtaj Bajraacharya’s descendants from Tadhichhen Baha renovated it (Tadhuchhen Bahal).
This Bahi, like the others, has a rectangular courtyard with modest chaityas. It also features the artwork of many Buddhas on its walls. Normally, the passage is less congested. During Samyak Mahadan, Pnchadan, and Gunla Parva, however, the site is packed with worshipers.",85.4330929,27.6723637,Heritage Site,Nepal
5,Dipankar Mahavihar,"Located inside a barely walked alley between Kwathandou and Bekhal, Dipankar Mahavihar is the home of one of the Dipankar Buddhas of Bhaktapur. He is supposed as the main Dipankar Buddha, thus after him, the vihar is named.
The statue of Dipakhar Buddha at Dipankar Mahavihar
As per the available scriptures, it was built in N.S. 750. And, fortunately, it is still in good condition, able to perform daily worshipping rituals and participate in Panchadan and Samyak Dan like holy events.
Beside Dipankar Buddha, there stands a statue of Mahankal, Manjushree, Ganesh and Shiva-Parvati, in this Mahavihar tagging the Red Tara. Some folk legends mention that Tara used to speak and was kept inside the bar while she was trying to leave the place.
That is why many Tibetans and people from the Himalayan regions often pay a visit to this place.
The temple of Red Tara at the premises of Dipankar Mahavihar
The Mahavihar, however, is also come to know as the home of Kumari of Bhaktapur. Each year, during Dashain, the living goddess Kumari resides here for 15 days.
Although, there is not much movement in the area, when you cross upon that road, a fragrance of incense steal away your attention. There is peace in the air.
While analyzing the spiritual values of that Mahavihar, one cannot just ignore the architectural form. The combination of the temple and local residents seems quite distinct yet attractive. The struts are as beautiful as the other wooden pieces of Bhaktapur. They are well carved and presented.
Dipankar Mahavihar
Likewise, there are Dharmadhatu Chaitya, Bajradhatu Chaitya, Khamba Chaitya, Gaju Chaitya, a hymning place (Sattal) with some fascinating paintings and a stone conduit on its premises. It’s a place worth visiting although the presence of local residents make you feel quite awkward, at first.

6,Jayakriti Mahavihar (Thathu Bahi),"Jayakriti Mahavihar, also known as Thatu Bahi is one of the most prominent vihars of Bhaktapur. Each year, Samyak Panchadan like-substantial event takes place over there.
It is located at Itachhen, on the western arena of the Na: Pukhu (Guhyepokhari of Bhaktapur). A two-storeyed building made out of a traditional Nepalese style (currently functioning as a Shree Gyan Bijaya Primary School) is also the house of one of the Dipankar Buddhas of Bhaktapur.
There is a beautiful courtyard inside the building where one can find small chaityas and stupa along with exquisite wood’s working and the image of Padmapani Lokeshwora, the central deity of the Bahi.
The vihar is placed in the highland, that’s why it is called thatu Bahi.
The vihar, as mentioned in the inscriptions and scriptures ascertains that it is way older than other vihars. The presence of two Chaityas and a gate with Panchabuddha summarises that it was made in the Lichhavi era.
There is even some chatter saying Na: Pukhu was later made on the land of Thathu Bahi.
It is said that the vihar was also renovated by King Jitamitra Malla and Ugra Malla after Jaya Ratna Bajracharya, who was a member of Chatur Varna Mahavihar.
The mentioned date when Jaya Ratna Bajracharya renovated it was N.S.794 and only after that, the Thatu Bahi was started to call Jayakriti Mahavihar. Moreover, it still seems to be in a good condition.",85.4218875,27.6728031,Heritage Site,Nepal
7,Chuma Ganesha Temple,"The uniqueness of this city never disappoints you especially when it comes to the name of places and temples. The Chuma Ganesha temple, designated as the very first Ganesh temple of Bhaktapur somehow, too falls in such fanciful legends and in weird naming.
Being located in Chochhen tole of Bhaktapur made it geographically the temple situated in the upper part of the Bhaktapur Nagara. It is said that Chochhen originally came up after the term Choye Chongu Chhen which means the house of the upper part.
Chuma Ganesh temple, on the other hand also has its own legendary story. Even the origin of its name has a story. It is said that the rats of that area beyond their nature scared the cats. And when someone tries to investigate the matter, they found out the image of Lord Ganesh.
Chuma Ganesha
Legends say that the name Chuma is derived from the term Chu and Ma which respectively means the rat and line. Thus, assuming Lord Ganesha worshipped by the large line of mice, the name of the temple began to be called Chuma Ganesha.
However, there is one more story that is slightly different from the aforementioned yet the core story of being rats powerful is the same. As per the story, when the king saw a fight between cat and rat and saw cat losing into the rat. He got amazed and follow the rat. There he found the Chuma Ganesh.
After being blessed by him, he was also told that there is Bhadrakali in the south of the area. And he should go there and worship her. The king as ordered went there and worship her. Being pleased by the king, she then gave him instruction to build a nagara in between these two areas; Chuma Ganesha and Bhadrakali temple.
Next, the king establishes the Bhaktapur Nagar along with the first Ganesh temple, Astamatrikas and Astabhairavas.
Besides, the architecture of the temple is likewise quite unique. Although it is a pagoda-style temple, its false tire has multiple layers like design which indeed is unique and satisfactory for the eyes.

8,Salan Ganesh Dyo Chhen,"Salan Ganesh Dyo Chhen is the god house of Salan Ganesh Temple. However, it is more famous as Agam dyo chhen than the dyo chhen.
The dyo chhen of Salan Ganesh is an exceptional architectural illustration. Unlike other dyo chhen (god’s house), which looks more like a residence but this dyo chhen owns some features matching the temple. Equivalently, it’s rare to find double torans even in temples too. Besides a pinnacle (Gajur) and beautiful carvings over struts, windows and doors made it more of a diversion to the orbs.
Agam dyo chhen
PC: Praz Santt/bhaktapur.com
The flanking stone lions’ home although is declared a world heritage site, yet we are not allowed to observe the interior. Because it still remains occupied by the local resident thus it’s not open to the public.
About the age of the dyo chhen, there is no exact record regarding its erection yet there are some guesses which tells us that it might have been built when the Salan Ganesh temple was built. It somehow makes sense too. Considering, the dyo chhen is of Salan Ganesh temple, it could have been built during the same time period.
The struts and the carvings
PC: Praz Santt/bhaktapur.com
Moreover, the famous architect Mr Wolfgang Korn also remarks that it may be incorrect to describe buildings of this type as temples because they are called even on Newari Dyochhens, which means god’s house. However, only the replica of god is quartered over there.
Well, it’s quite easy to find this architecture foregoing the parade of local residences. On the northern alley of Salan Ganesh puku, the last building to the very west is the dyo chhen of Salan Ganesh Temple.

9,Aesamari Sattal of Taumadhi Square,"Many of you might have heard about the word Aesamari Sattal and some might know which exactly the architecture is. Aesamari Sattal is non-other than that building, which resides right in front of the Nyatapola temple where “New Cafe Nyatapola” exists.
That building was said to be used by the priest who came to Bhaktapur, especially for the Biska Jatra. Also, the building was said to be the house of the essential elements of the biska jatra festival. 
There are numerous stories related to this particular building. It is said that there used to be a puja each year during Biska jatra in the Taumadhi square. That puja was specially held for the salvation of those spirits who had an unfortunate death. And the sages were said to make the big bread (roti or mari) in this particular place, thus it started to be called Aesamari Sattal.
Moreover, Aesamari Sattal is also unique in the aspect of depicting exceptional woodcarvings. Especially the erotic carvings. In the struts of this building, we can see numerous characters and their actions, beautifully depicting the then lifestyle.

10,Jetha Ganesh Temple,"The Jestha/Jetha Ganesh temple of pottery square dates back to the year 1646. Unlike other temples around, the Jetha Ganesh temple was not built by any king or the prince. Instead, it is said that it was donated by a wealthy person.
The architecture of the temple seems normal to us cause it’s a two-storeyed pagoda styled temple. But the importance of it does not rely on its normal architectural design. This temple is extraordinary because of the images of Astamatrika and Astabhairava. They are beautifully carved on the temple’s struts, which is very rare to find in any temple, even in the entire Kathmandu Valley.

11,Uma Maheshwor temple,"There are two temples of Uma Maheshwor in Bhaktapur. One among them is located on the way to the Sukuldhokha from Balakhu Ganesh temple. To be more precise, it is exactly located behind the Araniko Assembly Hall.
Uma maheshwor temple before the restoration  PC: Sunil Rajbhandari
This Uma Maheshwor temple is made off of stones and it was once somehow impacted by the plants of the pipal. Until the renovation, the temple was half overlaid by the trees. It almost looked like the trees were the roof of this temple. But today, we can clearly see the pinnacle of this temple.
The temple is one of the most artistic temples of Bhaktapur that were made in a Shikhara Style. Cause, unlike other temples, it is full of pristine carvings, especially on the pillars.
There is an image of Uma Maheshwor in the sanctum of the temple. The image of this temple was once stolen after the worshipping was totally stopped there.
It is said that the temple was first made during the reign of Prana Malla.",85.430169,27.672393,Heritage Site,Nepal
12,Bhajyapukhu of Bhaktapur,"Bhajyapukhu or Bhajupokhari of Bhaktapur is recently renovating under the act of Bhaktapur Municipality. This pond seems like a hidden pond of Bhaktapur cause it is labelled beside the line of various restaurants and local residences. But it is very easy to locate this pond. 
It lies right behind the Shiddhapokhari of Bhaktapur, on the southern arena. All you need to do is cross the road toward the south of Shiddhapokhari. Make the traditional pati to your right( which has a small outdoor shop) and keep going. Within a few steps, you would be standing on the northeast corner of the Bhajupokhari.
People used to play football in the pond, lightly a few years back because there was no water in this pond. It was totally dried up and was only limited in the name of the history of Bhaktapur. Even, in the history of Bhaktapur, there is no accurate information about this pond.
Regarding Culture Activist, Om Dhaubhadel, Bhajupokhari was built by a general commander of King Jitamitra Malla, Bhagiram Pradhananga (Bhaju Kasaju/ Bhaju Kasa). By whom’s name, the pond is named Bhajuya Pukhu which means the pond of Bhaju. Later, it started to be called Bhajupukhu and then Bhajyapukhu. However, people also prefer to call it Bhajupokhari which all means the pond named by Bhaju.
Since there is no exact information regarding the erection period of the pond, considering the life ventures of Bhaju Kasa, it is guessed that it probably was built during N.S. 811/812. However, it is no sure date of its erection.
For the reconstruction of the pond, some pre-research and excavation work was also held in that area by the team of Historian and Culture Activist Dr Purushottam Lochan Shrestha. Surprisingly, some facts regarding the preceding temple and its antiquity have been unveiled. 
As per the study, there used to be a shikhara styled temple with an image of Jaleshwor. The temple is said to be built in the middle of the pond just like in the Ranipokhari of Kathmandu.
Likewise, it is assumed that the Bhajupokhari of Bhaktapur was made to replicate the Ranipokhari of Kathmandu. More or less, it is also believed that an earthquake ruined the pond along with its history, making it still a mystery.",85.421144,27.670663,Heritage Site,Nepal
13,Tripurasundari Dhungedhara (the stone conduit of Tripurasundari),"The rectangular water conduit near Tripurasundari Temple is well known as the Dhungedhara (Lohahiti) of Tripurasundari. It is located at Tulachhen (north of the Jagannath temple of Tulachhen). Though the conduit is not functioning nowadays, it must have had great significance in past. Near the conduit, there is a pati (north side) which states that the conduit was built in N.S. 589 (1468 A.D.) by King Yakshya Malla.
Besides the extremely beautiful water conduit, there is a statue of Goddess Gajalaxmi, Vaikuntha Narayan Vishnu and a Shivalinga. This particular dhungedhara is also best known for one of the best images of Bhagirath.",85.430244,27.672749,Heritage Site,Nepal
14,Jagannath temple of Tulachhen,"Bhaktapur, without an unspecified reason, is not designated as the city of temples. You see, each corner of the path and chowks of Bhaktapur contains some kind of shrine. Somewhence, you would also find temples with different architecture but of the same names. Referring to this case, you can find one Jagannath temple in Durbar Square and another one at Tulachhen.
The temple of Jagannath which lies at Tulachhen is also one of the important temples of Bhaktapur. After witnessing a pillar with fine Garuda’s statue and big plinths, historians somehow assumed that it must be a grand temple. Though, today the temple is only one-storeyed but is able to protect the beautiful images of Jagannath.
The image of Jagannath
In the temple, the statue of Krishna is represented as Balbhadra Jagannath and is in Nil Varna which means Blue in colour. Likewise, the statue of Subhadra and Balaram( Baladev) are in Rakta Varna and Sweta Varna respectively.
Jagannath, Subhadra and baladev
As per the foundation of the temple, it is stated that it was built during the reign of King Prana Malla in N.S.663. Also, it was assumed to be built in Shikhara style.

15,The image of Chatur Narayan,"This image of Chatur Narayan (the four Narayan) is located right in front of the Jagannath temple of Tulachhen.  Most people tend to call this place, Markandaya Talau too, correlating to the Jagannath temple’s glory. By the style of the statue, it is assumed that it must be made during the 15th century.
The Lord Vishnu (Narayan) in this statue is in Samabhangaasan holding a lotus (Padma), the Indestructible Mace Of Lord Vishnu (Kaumodaki), a conch (Shankha) and the Unstoppable Disc Of Lord Vishnu (Sudarshana Chakra) in each of his four hands. Perhaps, because the place was once called a Talau (lake), the image of that Chatur Narayan is also worshipped as Jalhari. However,  to this day, regular puja is not conducted over there.",85.430346,27.67245,Heritage Site,Nepal
16,Digu Bhairava Temple,"Digu Bhairava Temple is one of the most prominent temples of Digu tole, thimi. The locals worship Digu Bhairava as their linage deity. Thus, the southern door of the temple is always kept open for the populace while the other door (the eastern one) is open on bare occasions.
It is a two-storeyed temple made in N.S. 600 (B.S. 1536) and one can easily reach over there. All you need to do is follow the same main road of thimi. Nearby, you could also find the temple of Digu Ganesha, Brihaspati, Narayan, Mahadeva, Chaitya, Dabalis and Patis.
Well, on one of those pati, one of the famous jatras of thimi, the tongue piercing one takes place that in each year after the day of Yenya Punhi (Indra jatra).

It is situated at Siwatole of Thimi. Around 110m east from the main road of Thimi and Thimi Layaku area.
It is a two-storeyed temple made in the pagoda style, facing toward the west. The gold-glided pinnacle, Shivalinga and traditional roofing style of this temple give an obsolete faithful vibe.

Nearby, there is another temple designed in the same outlet, named Siwa Ganesha temple. But, it is faced toward the south. By the architectural state, one can determine that it looks older than the other one.
However, it doesn’t end the number of temples located in that area. There is also a temple of Gaurishankhar, Bhairava, Siddhi Ganesha, Bu: Mahadyo (self emerged Mahadev), Golakhu Dyo (the nine deities) including various statues of god and goddesses which are both historically and culturally important.

To reach over there, all you have to do is follow the main road of thimi towards the north, until and at the end you see this Mahavihar on your right-hand side. 
Well, the inscriptions found here state that this Vihar is way older. As per the inscription, it was once renovated in N.S. 808. Likewise, the two golden images of Dipankar Buddha (one small and another big) was installed there in N.S. 684 (B.S.1621) and N.S. 689 (B.S. 1626).
Do you know that those images of Dipankar Buddha are roamed around in Thimi, Nagadesh and Bode on the day of Panchadan? That event is called Dipankar Jatra.
Besides, there is a  chaitya in this Mahavihar that is made anciently, recalling the lichhavi style of architecture. It apparently is the best thing to observe over there. However, there is one more statue of Bauddha Guru Padmasambhava which make this Vihar even more attractive.

Though this pond is not as big as Nigoo Pukhu, it had some sort of religious significance. In past, there used to hold a grand mela on the day of Gatha Muga cha: re.
This pond is about 600 m ahead (towards north) from Chardobato chowk. And, nearby there is a Compost Mal Kendra which produces agricultural chemicals using Japanese technology.

20,Shree 3 Vishnu Bir mai Temple (Sungaa Dyo),"Shree 3 Vishnu Bir Mai temple is one of the mattering temples of Thimi which is situated at Sungaa tole of Madhyapur Thimi. Perhaps, that’s why the temple is also called Sungaa Dyo. Or, maybe because of the name of Sungaa Dyo, the place started to call Sungaa Tole. 
Shree 3 Vishnu Bir Mai temple
Whatever the reason might be behind this naming but one thing is clear that this temple has a lot of significance. This temple is also called the temple of Vaishnavi, the shakti of Lord Vishnu.
Deities of Vishnu Bir Mai temple
During the Biska Jatra, the palanquin of this temple (the khat of Vishnu Bir) leads to the other five Ganesha’s palanquins. With that, there held a solo jatra of its called Vishnu Vir Khat Jatra at the end of the Baishak where its palanquin is roamed around the entire thimi. (Here, thimi is referring as the main thimi area)
The legends say that this temple was faced west and had 12 corners in the past. Meanwhile, today it is faced towards the east and is made in Gumbaj style. The temple houses unshaped images of God and Goddesses. In front of which, one can encounter a statue of Garuda, doing Namaste (adjoining hands position) and a hanging Pataah.

Today, the layaku (palace) of Thimi is functioning as the Aadarsha Secondary School. Although it is functioning as a school, some portion of this area is still used for cultural activities. The activities regarding Bhairava Dance, Taleju and many other culture-related activities are conducted from here. That’s why it is also called the cultural centre of Thimi.
Besides the cultural values, this place seems important for religious purposes. Each year during Biska jatra the statues of Balkumari are put over there, who is the main deity of Sindoor jatra. Also, the courtyard which has the Taleju temple is remarkably attractive although the section is still under construction.

22,Ranipokhari of Bhaktapur,"There is a Ranipokhari in Bhaktapur. Most people might have had no idea about this historic pond’s existence before the issue of its reconstruction. The mighty pond is said to be 40 years older than the Ranipokhari of Kathmandu. That’s why the Ranipokhari of Kathmandu used to be called “Nhu Pukhu “ which means the New pond. However, this Ranipokhari of Bhaktapur is not as big as Kathmandu’s.
Ranipokhari of Bhaktapur
As per the historian Dr Purushottam Lochan Shrestha, the Ranipokhari of Bhaktapur was ordered to be built by King Jagat Jyoti Malla, one of the greatest kings of Bhaktapur. It is assumed that he ordered the building of the pond in remembrance of his wife, Queen Rajlaxmi.
The found inscriptions state that it was built in 1687B.S.(1630 A.D, 750N.S.) within a timeframe of 5 months only. Later, it was renovated by King Jitmitra Malla in 1735. During the renovation, several statues of gods and goddesses were believed to be installed there. However, there are no signs of those artefacts in the current Ranipokhari.
Ranipokhari of Bhaktapur PC: bhaktapur.com/Prasant Prajapati
Unfolding history somehow reveals the facts that the pond was severally destroyed during the invasions of Kantipur and Lalitpur in Bhaktapur. Also, the artefacts appeared to be stolen during that time.  
It is said that there used to be a snake statue in the middle of the pond. As per some folklore, there stood the head of the “BasukiNaag” in this pond. Likewise, the body and the tails in the Shiddhapokhari and Na pukhu respectively. 
(These three ponds Ranipokhari, Shiddhapokhari and Na: Pukhu (Guhyepokhari) are considered sisters ponds.)
Besides the historical importance, it has another reason to be an important place to the Bhaktapurians. The Prajapati, Awal, Jochhen, Maharjan, Bhujitu, Rajlawat people of Bhaktapur do their digu puja at the premises of Ranipokhari. Moreover, they certainly perform the Ihi as well as the Bartabanda ceremony over there.

On the southern part of Ranipokhari, there is a “Sattal” which had great use in the past. It is said that when Bhaktapur used to welcome Harishiddhi Naach and Naradevi Naach that used to be held once in 12 years, the dancers, as well as their team, used to rest in that Sattal before entering the Bhaktapur Nagar.

Similarly, during Biska Jatra, a khadga used to come from Hanuman Dhoka Durbar which was also used to first settle down at the same sattal before entering Bhaktapur.
Ranipokhari now is open to the public as well.
(It was actually closed for the public since 2040 B.S. The land was used for army training and was under the control of the current Sainik Awasiya Vidhyalaya.)",85.415147,27.672136,Heritage Site,Nepal

Each year, the palanquin of Siddhi Ganesh used to be taken at Balkumari temple, during Biska Jatra. It was the only palanquin that used to depart from Nagadesha. And, only after the presence of the palanquin of Siddhi Ganesha, the Balkumari Jatra used to starts.

Leaving this conflict behind, if we talk about the temple’s architecture, then you surely would say that this is the most artistic temple of thimi.

Although the name of the temple is Siddhi Kali, the temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva, Lord Ganesh, and Goddess Kali along with Lord Bhairava and Nava Durga. The Siddhikali temple is also called Inayekwo dyo. Reasonably, cause it is located at Inayekwo Tole.
The siddhi kali temple premises
This two-storeyed temple is made in Pagoda style which showcases 17th-century architecture.  But the legends say that this Shaktipitha emerged from the fall of the right eye of Sati Devi. If you have heard or read about Swasthani Barta Katha, then it will be easier for you to understand this matter.
The temple of Siddhi Kali
As per the story, when Sati Devi died after jumping into the Yagya Kunda of her father’s (Dakshya Prajapati) Yagya, her immortal body was carried around by Lord Shiva (her husband). Because the body was carried by Lord Shiva himself, it did not dare to perish. However, because of that, Lord shiva started to live in grief, not caring about the universe. The only thing that he cared about was her body thus he continued to carry her and roam around the globe.
Seeing this despair of Lord Shiva, Lord Vishnu appeared as a fly and make the body of Sati perishable. Which after her body start to fall apart one by one. In that process, wherever the body part of Sati fell, a Shaktipitha emerged in that place. Thus, Shiddhikali appears to be the place where Sati’s right eye fell.

28,Wane Layaku,"Wane layaku of Dattatraya Square is very well hidden from the outside world. This layaku complex lies in the southwest corner of the Dattatraya temple. You need to go a little further from the rows of the restaurants to reach over there. Probably, that’s why it was never known to the world before.
However, this little complex is an important place from the point of view of history, culture, architecture and religion. As per the local anecdotes, the Taleju was first placed and worshipped over here. Later, it was transferred to the current Bhaktapur Durbar Square. Besides, this place is assumed one of the holiest places in Bhaktapur. No meat or sacrifice was ever allowed over here.
Also, during Dashain or the Mohni festival, there is a tradition of displaying a water clock in this Wane Layaku. Wane layaku, on the other hand literally means the eastern palace area. Here, wane means the east and layaku means palace or an important office area in the Nepal Bhasa. So, it actually makes sense, the naming of this place.
The complex, till today consists of the Wane Layaku itself (the Devagriha). It is made in the traditional Newa Agam Architectural style with the beautiful windows of the Malla era. The struts of this Devagriha are also carved with the beautiful figures of different deities.
It is said that there is a statue of Tulaja Bhawani in this Devagriha. With that, there is a Jaladroni (water tank) made in N.S. 770 and a plant, actually a tree in this complex. 
Many of you might have this thought that why even a tree is mentioned in this post. Yes, this tree is mentioned over here because it witnessed a large history and beheld a belief. It is said that the tree is as old as the Agam Chhen itself and it never needed any care to grow this large.
Moreover, there is one more tenet about this complex. Believe it or not, the rumours say that in this complex, no grass has ever grown till today. However, the roof seems exception in this case.",85.435147,27.673234,Heritage Site,Nepal

30,Yetachapari,"Yetachapari is a long inn/resthouse that one can encounter in the south of the Bhaktapur Durbar Square. Nowadays, people prefer to call it Lamopati (a Nepalese word meaning long inn) rather than Yetachapari. Many of us might have had no idea about its original name before this.
This two-storeyed building was used to sit, to have an audience for the king, and observe cultural programs held in front of the palace or dabali (the traditional stage-like space). However, it is still used to sit and observe several festivals and events. Even when there are no festivals or events, one can simply enjoy the spectacular views of the Royal palaces and temples of Bhaktapur Durbar Square standing behind them.
Did you know that this Yetachapari was bigger than this?
Yes, it was big and was twice bigger than this. It was after the earthquake of 1990 that its reconstruction was made a bit far from the palace which traverses to a good space at Bhaktapur Durbar Square. Well, you couldn’t find such long inns as Yetachapari in Patan and Basantapur Durbar Square.
Well, you could find the old images of Lamopati in our old photo collection.

31,Tadhuchhen Bahal,"Tadhuchhen Bahal or Ta: dhi chhen is more familiar as Chaturvarna Mahavihar. The bahal is also termed Bahal, Baha, or Vihar (Mahavihar) in the Nepalese term. That’s why it is called in various ways.
Tadhuchhen Bahal was ordered to erect by King Raya Malla. An inscription like-board in the Vihar clearly states that it was built in N.S. 611 (1492 A.D). It also states that the Kings: Ram Malla, Raya Malla, Ari Malla, and Avaya Malla collaboratively invited Jibchandra Bajracharya and ceremoniously made him the main Gubaju of the Bahal. 
This vihar is also called Surat Shree Chaturvarna Mahavihar. It is said that the pioneer priest of the Vihar, who was Jibchandra Bajracharya, was also the son of the famous Tantrik Gubaju of that era, Surat Bajracharya. Considering a tribute to him, the initial name of the Vihar was named Surat Shree Chaturvarna Mahavihar. 
Also, about calling the place the Kumari House, it’s not like the kumari of Bhaktapur resides over there. But yes, it is said that the initial kumari of Nepal was established over there. Additionally, King Ranajit Malla also had set some rules regarding Kumari in the place as well.
Perhaps, that’s why it is also called Kumari house. Nowadays, only during Dashain (Mohni), for a week, the former Kumari is brought up here to fulfill some holy rituals.
Things to notice on Tadhuchhen Bahal
The Tadhuchhen Bahal is an attractive component in itself though there are many other things that surpass your imagination. Being in this centuries-old monastery, you might get wonder, conceiving what exactly is this place.  It looks like a blend of Buddhism and Hinduism.
The courtyard of this Bahal is surrounded by a pha-cha (a walkway on four sides) and the enclosed quadrangle is paved with brick tiles (chikanapa). There is a twayamapau i.e. a toran (a semi-circular decorative panel that normally is made either of wood or metal) hung above the main entrance gate of the bahal and above the sanctum as well.

Basically, it is decorated symbolizing the three jewels or the five Buddhas of the deity inside the shrine. So, glancing at them not only made you realize the great artistic views but also the religious aspects of creating them.
Erecting various protective deities is another feature of the Bahās and the Bahis. That’s why you could see the wooden sculptures of Ganga-Jamuna right after the entrance on your right and left in the Bahal. Also, there are statues of Bhairava and Ganesh on the struts to protect the Bahal from all bad happenings.
It is said that the image of Mahānkālto overcomes all dangers and a Chetrapāl protected the shrine.  You would also encounter Stupas and a stone Mandal in the courtyard. There is a belief that the center of this Mandal has a figure of Manjughosh, a form of Manjushree. 
Close to the Dharmadhatumandal (the stone Mandal) of a courtyard, there is a base for sacrifice place called Jogisāla in Newāri. It is used for Homa or fire sacrifice rituals. Plus, there is a statue of panchadhyani buddha with its shakti. Besides all these spiritual monuments, you could somehow, also encounter quite impressive things over there.
Yes, while you are there, don’t avoid glancing at the struts of the eastern part of the shrine. There are some wooden portraitures that portray the punishment of limbo which are returned according to their karma. It is a fact that wherever the temple of Lokeshwor exists these kinds of portraitures also exist.
The image shows two persons with huge stomachs. As per the locals, those big men could eat only one grain at a time. It was their punishment. So, they always starve to the death.

32,"Wakupati Narayan Temple, Bhaktapur","Wakupati Narayan Temple is a two-story pagoda temple dedicated to Lord Vishnu, enclosed within a stone-paved courtyard. It is located at Suryamadhi, Bhaktapur. A few minutes of walk from Chyamasingha towards the west leads you to this temple.
This temple is also called Wakupati Changu Narayan temple. People who couldn’t go to Changunarayan for prayer choose to go to Wakupati Narayan temple. It is like a substitution of the Changu Narayan temple.
Wakupati Narayan temple and premises
About the erection of this temple, it is said that the temple was built in 1667. However, there is one interesting story regarding the emergence of the Wakupati Narayan, the deity. As per the story, one devotee of Narayan who daily went to Changu Narayan had to stop going there because of the harvesting works.
He was too busy to visit the temple thus he remembers the Narayan, pray spiritually and go to work. One evening when he was returning back home with the sack of paddy, he found the image of Lord Vishnu in his sack. Since it was found within the sack of paddy, it was named Wakupati Narayan.
Here, Wakupati Narayan simply means the seen Vishnu while carrying the sack of paddy.
The temple by date seems more archaic than the Nyatapola temple and is in very good shape today. Despite some damage to neighbouring buildings, the ornate, golden temple survived the 2015 quake outlasting various distinct quakes.
Well, while you visit this temple, you would surely note the entourage of five Garudas supported on pillars on the backs of turtles. This is the only place where one would see five Garudas standing back to back in a row. However, the nearest one seems like a devotee rather than the Garuda as in the Dattatraya temple. You can clearly recognize the human face in it. But there are wings too to call him human as well.

Along with such mysterious creatures, there is an ancient stone tap inside the courtyard. Also, the stone scriptures of God and Goddesses. There is a statue of Lord Ganesha on the right side of the temple. Similarly, there is the image of Dasavatar of Lord Vishnu right behind the temple. You can have a guess recognising each of them while existing from that narrow space of the temple.
Nearby, there is a stone image of Goddess Saraswoti. There is even a temple of Chinna Masta, one among the Das Mahavidhyas on the southern arena of the main shrine.

A huge mass of people visits the temple at Ekadashi. Although, people stay up during the Nitya Puja as well. Each day, in the morn and on the eve, the Pujari of the temple performs daily worship. And to witness that, the nearby people especially the senior citizens gather over there. 
Just within a while, you could see the gang of these older people on the premises of this temple who tend to laugh and gossiping in the patis (resthouse) of Suryamadhi, a minute before. They reach over there in such a perfect time as if it’s their daily routine to be there.
And of course, perceiving those glimpse of old people who shares a sort of stories with each other, including strangers like us really brings a smile to your face. Thus, It would be great if you could reach there in the evening, around 6 pm.
Also, there is a belief among the local denizens that if people sit in the courtyard while visiting the temple, the back pain is cured. It is like the blessing of God. So the people of Bhaktapur, still sit there at least once while visiting the temple, even if they are in a super hurry.
Wait, there is more to explore on the premises of this temple. Among several patis and minor temples from the premises, the pati from the end of the east corner consists of more exaggerating wooden artworks. It looks like leaving unavoidable crafting is a sign of the then Nepalese architecture.

As per the cited stories, the locals didn’t find a good and wide place to do a grand welcome of the then King. Thus, they dried up the pond. But, unfortunately, it became a dry meadow and an un-managed field after that.
The concerned authority could not make it to its initial face until Mr Madan Sundar Shrestha, the Mayor of Madhyapur Thimi associated his work and post toward protecting these heritage sites.

Just accessing through the main door and reaching the inner yard would leave you with a big wonderment. But yes, before reaching there, you need to show your yellow-colored ticket to the guards of the museum.
If you already have visited the National Art Museum of Bhaktapur Durbar  Square or the Brass and Bronze Museum, then you don’t need to buy another one here. The same ticket works for you.
The ground floor of the wood carving museum
The rich wood carvings start to appear as soon as you step into the wood carving museum. The windows of the following floors, the struts, and the wooden pillars, make us realize that yes, we are in the woodcarving museum.
In the straight corner, there is a mask of Jayamal often called Jaya or Jai. He was a far-famed wrestler of the Malla era.
In front of it, there is a stairway that leads you to the very top and the third floor of the building.
*On the museum’s first floor, there is a room filled with wall paintings. But nevertheless, you might not call it actually a wall painting because the paintings are painted on a wooden platform that is attached to the room’s walls.
There are paintings depicting the Ramayana and Krishna Leela stories. On the beam, there are paintings of Nava Durgas (Astamatrika), Lord Vishnu’s Dasa Avatar. The room is literally filled with paintings, as there are paintings even on the ceilings.
Now, coming back to the third floor, you will find some of the most exquisite pieces of wooden art over there.
The museum is like a paradise for art admirers and practitioners. There are several statues made in the woods which consist of the statue of Bhairava, Vishnu, Buddha, Nitya Devi, Tara, Bhrikuti, Ganesha, Shiva, and many others.
The most satisfying part of being in the museum is that you can take pictures of these centuries-old crafts.
With the statues, there are torans, wooden pillars, and even boxes (safes) of different eras.
Besides these things, there is one unique thing that indeed is quite different from the ancient newa culture. A tiny window made out of brick, not the woods.
There might be some sort of story behind outputting such a window. Yet, there is one more thing that not only surprises you but also startled you.
After entering the third floor of the museum, you will find a small room on your left-hand side. It mentions that there is a statue of Bhairava with shakti (shakti means his consort) and some wall paintings.
Even after keeping that thing in your mind before entering over there, you would probably get startled. So, keep calm and enjoy what’s inside there.

After the blessing of King Yakshya Malla, it was rebuilt in 1763. And again renovated by German experts as the wedding gift to the then King Birendra in 1979.
The peacock window, being the most alluring woodcraft from the 15th century, even today made us come for it.

You might also find people calling it Luhiti, which also means the golden conduit exactly in Nepal Bhasa ( most commonly known as the newari language).
Sundhara, on the other hand, is a symbol of unique aesthetic grace which is as its name is golden. It has one of the most extricating carvings on the mouth of the spout. The head of a non-castrated he-goat and the figures of different animals and Gods posing in that court really make you say, awe-inspiring.
Furthermore, in front of Sundhara, there is a diminutive pond, in the middle of which an image of gold-plated Naag with a wooden pillar does stand. Perhaps, that’s why people also call this arena Naag Pokhari rather than Sundhara.
Well, around the Sundhara and the pond, you can examine the brick thoroughfare with the stonewall enclosed by the amounts of the serpent including numerous figures of Gods and Goddesses.
Thus, it is unique.
About the making of Sundhara
Bhaktapur and its monuments, never stay emptied without an ambiguous and fascinating story. So, the same goes for this Sundhara.
King Jitmitra Malla, who seems to have contributed a lot to making temples, courtyards, and the palace itself was also one of the most creative kings of Bhaktapur. It is said that one night the Goddess Taleju obliged herself before King Jitamitra Malla, in his dream while the construction of the Thanthu royal palace was on, to the east of Taleju temple.
Know more about the Malla kings of Bhaktapur.
She then instructed him to make preparation for fetching water from the Mahadev river of Nagarkot to carry out the periodic worship of Taleju in the palace.
Consequently, water was then collected from around the smaller streams originating from Mahadev mountain in big storage. It was then diverted into a pond for necessary treatment and finally brought to the golden spout inside the palace through the Royal Cannel (Raj Kulo).
(That pond might be called today’s Mahadev Pokhari, where every year, on the month of Poush/Magh, devotees come and take bath as well as worship at the nearby Mahadev temple.)
The initiated work of constructing Sundhara along with the pond was begun in 1678 (798 Nepal Sambat) and completed in 1683 (803Nepal Sambat).
There is an even more impressive story recounted about this Sundhara. As per the anecdote, on the inauguration day of this Sundhara and pond, religious worship was offered to the Taleju Goddess invoking Tantrik Shakti, and a pair of white ducks were left to flow through this spout.
Legend has it that these ducks easily passed through the mouth of Sundhara turning into a smaller size. They were seen swimming in the pond. This process of appearing and disappearing of these ducks was said to be observed till some generations of the Malla period.

More about the Sundhara
The earliest water source of this conduit was Mahadev Pokhari, Nagarkot which later was taken over by the modern piped system.
However, amid the disruption of Raj Kulo, Sundhara also lost its natural source of water, and today, the modern piped system has been enlarged with the existing infrastructure of Sundhara. Though the water supply is limited and the water streams, for a few hours in the morning and evening for religious worship which also seems not regular.
The water Sundhara was used for the worship of the Thanthu palace. Also, the king and queen used to take bath in this conduit before leaving to have a rest near the Khopi (resting room).
The water of this conduit is still used to worship the Goddess Taleju. However, sometimes, the irregularity of the water flow compels to use of the encaged pond water nearby for religious worship in the Taleju temple.

39,Salan Ganesh Temple and the pond,"Within the sphere of Dattatreya Square, there are three more temples that hold both cultural and religious paramount. Among them,  the Salan Ganesh Temple is the one, which lies in the right-hand corner of the square.
A narrow street leads the way to the temple. The temple is particularly special because of the image of Lord Ganesh. But, it is not a sculpture. The image is rooted in a natural stone that has a symbolic form of Ganesha or the elephant-headed image.
Nowadays, it became more indistinguishable because of the red tika, covered all over it.
The Salan Ganesh is also sub-titled as the Adhi Ganesh among the asta Ganesh. During the procession process in Gai jatra, this temple is revolved by a bunch of people. Thus, because of that, it was called Salan Ganesha.
However, until today, the exact erection date of the temple has not been defined. Yet, some guesses call it the temple developed in the 13th century. Sumerialy, the date 1654 also arouses as its erected date. 
Salan Ganesha pokhari
Salan Ganesh Pokhari
The pond behind the Salan Ganesha Temple is said to be dedicated to the temple. That’s why it is named the Salan Ganesha pokhari. Consequently, the eve made this pond fill with young people as well as the old ones. While, for now, there is no use of this pond except for having a peaceful time with friends.
Furthermore, it is presumed that the pond might have been in existence since the 16 or 17th centuries. From then till today, this pond remains in its initial structure. Along with the length and width of 300 and 150 ft respectively.
Nearby, in the north direction of the pond, there is an Agam Chhen of the respective temple. The architecture is best known for its eccentric display of woodcarvings. All the torans, windows, doors, as well as struts, are shaped in beautiful patterns.

40,The existence of Laxmi Narayan temple in Dattatraya Square,"There are so many Narayan temples within the Bhaktapur Nagar. So that people often get confused about the names of the temples. However, the places and their architecture, distinguish them from each other. The Laxmi Narayan temple stands out as the most unique Narayan temple in the Bhaktapur Nagar. 
Location wise, the Laxmi Narayan temple lies on the premises of Dattatreya Square. That, in the northern arena of the square.
Though this temple was erected in the 18th century, it still bears to stand in between us.
Architecturally, it is made off of multiple roofs. Which is more likely the traditional roofing style of Nepal. Although it is made in a traditional format, it still has some uniqueness. More than any other temple which seems similar to traditional architecture.
Moreover, on the other hand, this tiny heritage site is also a fine example of wood adeptness. One can observe the very well wood carvings in its entrances and torans.
Plus, there is a pair of lions too, in front of its entrance. That generally symbolizes the temple of Devi and the attending vehicles of Mahalaxmi. Since the temple is honoured to both Laxmi and Narayan, the statues of lions were established there. While the entrances are filled with carvings of snakes too.
Furthermore, the Laxminarayan temple is blessed with the pristine image of Laxmiarayan. But that doesn’t mean there are two statues of the deities i.e Laxmi and Narayan.
Instead, there is only one image which generally is of a combined form of Laxmi and Narayan. If you take an attentive look at the statue, then you realize it. That the statue actually has two different figures as well as bearings.",85.434959,27.673637,Heritage Site,Nepal
41,Bhimsen temple of Bhaktapur,"There are still several temples and heritage sites in Bhaktapur which has no evidence of their existence. Yet, they are standing in front of us. But, its history is somewhere else. No one accurately knows about them. In those dusting and busts of the city, the erection of the Bhimsen temple also got faded.
Somehow, the archaeologists presume, it was erected in 1605 CE. While some other sources dated it back to the 18th century.
This two-floored rectangular pagoda, the temple of Lord Bhimsen is located right in front of the Dattatreya Temple within the premises of Dattatrya square. Plus, it was renovated lately in the year 2018. However, it is standing in its initial structure until now. As the name of the temple assumes, it is the temple of lord Bhimsen.
The Bhimsen temple is often called Bhisindyo or Bhindyo by the local people.
This Bhimsen temple is extraordinarily large in length unlike any other temple in Bhaktapur. Plus, there are 7 pinnacles crowning in the tiny and pretended tier of the temple.
The windows, doors, and struts alike are filled with beautiful carvings. For instance, the temple is not only blessed with the Bhimsen but also with the statue of Draupati. Here, Draupati is one of the main characters of Mahabharata, who was also the wife of Panch Pandava.
Adding more, the ground floor of its looks like a resting place. Since it is open to everyone and has nothing except a big space. Within the same series, there is a doorway guarded by two stone images. Ultimately, that portal guides to the main temple of Bhimsen.
About the Lord Bhimsen
Bhimsen is a god with a red face, angry eyes, and a thick dark moustache. He is worshipped as the god of trade and commerce. Perhaps, because of that, every household has had its portrait, especially in the shops. They believe that the praying of Lord Bhimsen would bring good fortune and success in business.
Bhimsen
Usually, the local people come and worship in the temple but the traders often come on Saturday to do worship. It seems Saturday is one special day to worship Bhimsen. Besides that, the bhimsen is worshipped especially on Holi Purnima and Yomari Purnima.
Bhimsen pokhari of Bhaktapur
With the temple, a conduit is attached, right to its back. That is a conduit but for some unknown reason, it is also called a pond. That’s why that conduit along with the assumed pond is called Bhimsen pokhari.
Meanwhile, some shreds of evidence show up as the conduit made in the lichhavi period. The northern, as well as the southern steps, still have some sort of carving evidence.  That mentioned the name of some, of the then rulers of Bhaktapur like Raya Malla, Ram Malla, Rana Malla, and Bhim Malla. It was placed during its renovation.
With that, different classic statues like the statue of Narayan with four hands, Chandra, Surya, Ganesh, and some others are also established over there. Similarly, as the attraction, the conduit itself beholds the antique beauty.

Til Madhav Narayan
Til Madhav Narayan is one of Lord Vishnu’s incarnations. Even if no one could enter the temple, the statue of Garuda, conch and wheel confirmed the presence of the deity. There is also Lord Natyeshwor, who is supposed to have been established there to protect Til Madhav Narayan.
According to the temple priest, the depiction of Til Madhav Narayan differs greatly from other renderings of Narayan. He explained that this statue only has three hands. Another restriction is that no worshipers are permitted to visit the shrine or even see the Lord Narayan statue.
And, yes, photography is not permitted inside the temple.
The temple is open from 4 a.m. to 8 p.m. During this period, the priest performs Nitya puja at around 5:30 a.m. and Sandhya Aarati at 5 p.m.

Til Madhav Narayan, the deity who blesses the devotees with children
A courtyard, in addition to the temple, is considered sacred by Bhaktapurians. Because Ihi, one of the most essential rituals of every newa girl, was sometimes performed there.
In addition, on important occasions, devotees from faraway regions such as Pharping and Panauti come here in the hope that the Lord may grant their wishes. According to the temple priest, if anybody obtains the clarified butter (Ghee) of the naval of the Til Madhav Narayan on the fourth day of the Magh, his/her request is granted.

The temple itself is of a three-falsehood which has amusingly impressive hanging Pataas. It also has a column in front of it, which has a beautiful representation of a peacock. There were more peacocks in its tier corners. But they all were stolen, leaving one among them.

The legends about the Balkumari temple
The temple has a long story, nearly dating back to the 17th century. Of course, cause the temple was established at that time. The legends say that a merchant of Madhyapur usually went to Lubu for trading purposes along with his group. But he somehow fell in love with the princess of the Lubu and vice versa.
Soon, the princess also got pregnant. For that reason, she asked the merchant to take her away with him to the thimi. The merchant happily accepted her proposal but at the same time, he put a condition too.
The condition was that if she wanted to come to thimi with him, she must bring the balkumari with her.
That the princess also happily accepted and brought the deity to the thimi. From that time, the deity was permanently shifted to thimi.
Plus, there is a womb-like structure right above the idol of the deity. That, in some way, justifies the story of shifting the deity by the pregnant woman.

The Balkumari temple became a course of titling and tattling when it came to the Biska Jatra. Yes, because this temple is foremost related to the vermilion festival, ordinarily known as Sindur Jatra. The jatra initially starts from this temple. But her chariot is not rounded to the whole city as other chariots do.
Her chariot is taken up to the temple of Prachanda Bhairva. Since it is believed that the ancient thimi was bordered that place in the north.

King Bhupatindra Malla erected it in 1698 A.D. Also, picturesque it as Malatichwok. But locals prefer to call it Simhadhwoka layaku rather than Malatichwok. Later, in 1960, the Government of Nepal and the Department of Archaeology set it up as the National Art Gallery.
The National Art Museum was inaugurated by Bishwesvar Prasad Koirala. He was Nepali Congress Supreme and the very first elected prime minister of Nepal.
Consequently, this museum is the best among the three museums of Bhaktapur. You can easily find this place, once you enter the Bhaktapur Durbar Square. The two stone images of lions pleasantly embrace you.

Along with that, another stone sculpture of Hanumanta-Bhairav and Nar-Shima also shows you the way toward the museum.

Statue of Narshima
Notwithstanding, this museum has a small acquisition. But, it has a good collection of manuscripts and chronicles, which date back to the 11th century. Similarly, it is the home of ancient Paubha Scroll paintings, tantric cloth paintings. Also, the artefacts of bronze, brass, stone, and wooden images.
This architecture is not in its fundamental shape after the devastating earthquake of 1934 A.D. Yet, was also harmed in the quake of 2015. But, it is protecting a lot of unique discoveries in it. That includes the stone varieties on its ground floor.
The ground floor of the National Art Museum
As you enter the National Art Museum, you would find a counter where you have to pay and take the tickets. Advantageously, you won’t need to buy tickets for another two museums of Bhaktapur ( wood carving museum and the brass and bronze museum), once you buy one over there.
The tour of the Museum starts with the masks of Nava Durga, the most prestigious deities of the Bhaktapur, and the statue of four-handed Ganesha. Along with that, you can notice some stone inscriptions on your right-hand side.
The next room separated by a door somehow offers you more than the old inscriptions and masks. You would encounter the four-faced shivaling and other reverse statues of Surya, Kubera, Vishnu, Ardhanareshwor, Tara, Laxmi Narayan, and many more.
With that, this floor displays the most erotic paintings of god and goddess, specially dedicated to the Bhairava and his shakti. The description regarding those paintings says that the bhairava over here is shown in an extensive system of yogic union with his shakti, Bhairavi.
Simply looking at these paintings, one can see them engaging in sexual posture but the philosophy of such posture is quite different from what one sees through eyes. Those postures depict the tangible expression of the metaphysical concept that salvation results from the yogic union of the male and female organs.
However, there is one more image consisting of Mahasambhara that portrays the Mahasambhara, one of the popular deities of the Vajrayana cult of Buddhism in his extensive system of Yogic union with his shakti, Bajrabarahi.
The first floor of the National Art Museum
The very first floor of the National Art Museum is filled with paintings of different eras. And, it has an all-embracing paintings collection of airbrushing Vasundhara, Ganesh Shakti, Mahisa Sambhara, Vajra Yogini, Asta Bhairava with their shakti, and Shiva. It also has the classic paintings of Krishna Leela and Madhukaitavabadha.
The images of various kings and princes after King Prithi Narayan Shah are also depicted over there. The very first thing that you would notice over there is those immense memories of the kings.
Furthermore, the stage has centuries-old written inscriptions which apparently make us wonder and think about the inventions of that era. On top of that, the handwriting is super good.

By the sequence, King Bhupatindra Malla erected that temple. That was of the shikhara style. Unfortunately, the devastating earthquake of 1990B.S. turned this temple into a Nepalese roofing style temple.
It sounds quite weird. But another devastating earthquake of April 2015 brought this temple in its real posture. Today, the temple is again in the same shape. Yes, it is in the shikhara style as it was originally built.
Moreover, the most valuable thing, that this temple consists of is the statue of the Harihar. It is a combining form of lord shiva and Vishnu. That people call Badri Narayan or Badrinath. That then turns out to be the name of this temple.
Consequently, as the Badrinath temple. Most of the people know this temple as one of the pilgrimages of char Dham temples too.",85.427455,27.672046,Heritage Site,Nepal
48,Kedarnath temple,"The Kedarnath temple look-alike like the Badrinath Temple since both of them are made in terracotta form. The temple is called Kedarnath because of the statue of Kedaraeshwor that is established in the phallus of the temple.

There are a total of five pinnacles in the temple including four sub-pinnacles. And, architecturally, they all turn in four directions. Despite that, it looks so splendid, of course, with the statues of lord shiva in it.

Consequently, this temple lies right in front of the Gopinath temple. While you enter from the west entrance to the durbar square, you can find this temple on your right-hand side.
The artistic king of the Malla era, King Bhupatindra Malla is credited for such beautiful work.

Also, the struts, are filled with the images of incarnations of Lord Vishnu and other deities. That makes this temple more refined and elegant.
This temple is popular as the Radhakrishna temple but alternatively, also recognizes under the name of Gopinath temple. Furthermore, This temple is also famous as the dwarikanath temple because of a statue established inside this temple.
The statue established inside the temple is of Lord Krishna. That seems more artistic and admiring. Not only the statue of Lord Krishna but also the statue of Balram and Radha are beautifully placed over there.

Yes, however, this Jagannath temple consists of a place among char Dham temples.
The current temple of Jagannath seems quite ordinary covered with a tin roof.  This one-story temple was three times bigger and of two stories on its erection. The ruinous earthquake of 1934 A.D. somehow spectacularly affects the physical appearance of this temple.

52,Chyasalin mandap,"The octangular Chyasalin mandap pavilion is not a temple, despite the fact that most people mistake it for one.
Despite the fact that it is only a pavilion, it is one of the most stunning constructions of the Malla era. The kings of Bhaktapur, however, were not responsible for its construction. The entire credit goes to King Srinivas Malla, the then-King of Lalitpur who erected it as a sign of friendship.
Aside from that, there is an intriguing story concerning the Chyasalin mandap’s construction, which explains why it was built between the Pashupatinath temple and the 55-window palace. There is a Hindu concept that one should not live in front of the glorious deity.
And living directly in front of the Pashupatinath shrine was bad for both the king and the kingdom. Thus, Chyasalin Mandap is reported to be built in between them to avoid the temple’s powerful aurora from directly striking the palace.
This venue once was also a popular choice for the poetry contest. According to published knowledge, King Bhupatindra Malla and his consort once held a poetry competition at this spot.
This pavilion was also used to welcome royal guests, observe festivals, and enjoy the breathtaking sunset views.
Unfortunately, it was destroyed by the catastrophic earthquake of 1934 A.D. and lost its original form. Later, in 1992 A.D., the German architects graciously reinstall this covering at its original speed. They used steel and the ruins of the old chyasalin mandap there.

Meaning of Lanpadegal
Coming to the lanpadegal, lanpadegal is the local name of those stone lions. Meanwhile, People started calling those stone lions lanpadegal. Because it stands as an obstruction in the road.
The lanpadegal consists of three newari words. Lan, pa, and dega ( degal). That means road, obstruction, and temple respectively. Therefore, people know this temple as a temple bothering the road. According to this, lanpadegal became the name of this site.
Lanpadegal, before the quake
There was a lovely three-story pagoda-style temple with an outstandingly artistic Harihar statue. According to legend, there were three Harihar temples within the durbar square, and this temple was one of them.
Aside from that, we are grateful that Harihar’s statue has been saved. It is now on display at the National Art Museum. And, those magnificent lions were established in front of the temple before the catastrophic earthquake of 1934 AD occurred in Nepal.

This temple devoted to lord bhairava is one of the rectangular based temples of Bhaktapur. One could easily recognize this temple as it lies right behind the giant Nyatapola temple.
The Bhairavanath established in this temple is a formidable incarnation of lord shiva, who also prefers to name Kasi Vishwanath and Aakash bhairava. He is somehow famous for his obstreperous and stubborn character. 
Renovative history of Bhairavanath Temple

However, that area, before the establishment of the temple was already popular for the Shaivism pilgrims. It was well known as Lalitmaheshwor. Regarding which there are inscriptions found in the temple.
But, it was definitely not triple-roofed, then. During the reign of King Vishwa Malla, the temple was gracefully restored in a one-storeyed temple.
After, King Jagatjyoti Malla decorated it with golden roofs.
Likewise, in N.S. 788, King Jagat Prakash Malla established his own image along with his minister Chandrashekhar in the temple while having a grand worshipping.
Later on, King Bhupatindra Malla modified it into a triple roofed temple at around N.S. 837-38 (1718 AD) and added the seven golden pinnacles in it. (Renovation of Bhairavanath temple, Bhaktapur Municipality)
The reconstruction took time after the engineering of the Nyatapola temple.

By worse luck, the devasting earthquake of 1934AD collapsed it.  And optimistically reassembled in the same structure. The ruinous earthquake of April 2015 again, made this temple renovated. It also destroyed the tiny way, passing through the betal temple. That ultimately leads toward the interior part of the Bhairavanath temple.
The anecdote about Bhairavanath
With a renovative history, this temple also owns an interesting anecdote, passed orally by our ancestors. According to this, the lord bhairava of Varanasi once visited Bhaktapur to see bisket jatra.
Bisket jatra is one of the biggest jatras of the newar people. During the festival, the lord Bhairava somehow was recognized by a priest and he just cast a decoy spell on him. 
As a quick reaction, he started to sink into the terra firma to go back to Varanasi. But the priest didn’t let him go. As if, he grabs the head of Bhairava in his hand and decollates him with his sword. That’s why people say that the head doesn’t match the body of Kasi Vishwanath. It is also believed that the head is still treasured in a box of this temple.",85.42952,27.671039,Heritage Site,Nepal

Those postures are based on the traditional erotic text Kamasutra.

guardians-nyatapola
Whenever you pass through those stone steps of Nyatapola. Once in a time, a thought arises in mind, why these stone images are here, and what are they?
Symphonically, there are five plinths in Nyatapola, where each plinth has a pair of stone images.
It is said that they are the guardians of the Goddess Shiddhi Laxmi. From the bottom to the end of the plinth, there is a stone image of Wrestlers, Elephants, Lions, Griffins, and two Goddesses named Sighini and Baghini respectively.
They all are placed according to their strengths. The first two wrestlers named Jai and Pratap are said to be 10 times stronger than a normal man. Along with that, the elephants, who are considered as 10 times stronger species than those wrestlers are placed above them.
With such a ratio, the guardians are placed.
Statue of Shiddhi Laxmi
The foremost deity of the Nyatapola temple is the Goddess Shiddhi Laxmi. Since it is a powerful tantric deity. No ordinary people are allowed to enter this temple. So, no one knows how the deity looks besides the priests. But, we can imagine her in our thoughts.

The stone tap
Right behind the temple, a north-facing stone tap unknowingly adds beauty to this structure.  The first plinth of the temple holds this tap.
The struts
Just like the stone images, the strut images are also magnificent. Probably, they are the best show of woodcarving. The very first and the second floor’s struts have wooden images of Astamatrika. That means the images of Bramayani, Maheshwari, Kumari, Vaishnavi, Barahi, Indrayani, Mahakali, and Mahalaxmi.
Continuously, the struts of the third tier have an image of Lokeshwor. In the same way, the images of Mahalaxmi and Shiva-Shakti are carved in the fourth and fifth tier’s struts respectively. Therefore, this eye-glancing structure is also filled with the most artistic woodcarvings.

Also, this grand temple stands as the tallest Nepalese roofing-styled temple of Bhaktapur. As well as Nepal with a height of 33meters.
The whole structure of Nyatapola was raised within 214 days. During that era, meanwhile, there was no advanced construction equipment at all.
It is said that the wind bells hanged around the tiers of Nyatapola were in several 529. But placing them in the numbers 48, 80, 104, 128, and 168, from top to bottom respectively, outlasts a wind bell. That was then, considered as the unfortunate one wind bell. And, the fact is that till today no one knows about it, whether where it was placed. Or, what did happen to it?

There, local persons also call these 55 windowed palaces, pachpannajhyale durbar. And in newari term nge nyapa jhya laaykoo. Consequently, this artistic fact holds back history from about 1427 AD. Before King Bhupatindra Malla remodelled it in the 17th century.
After succeeding originally constructed by king Yaksa Malla. Yes, this is also a fact. That it was just a building then when king Yaksha Malla concreted it.
A brief history of 55 window palace
Later on, when King Bhupatindra Malla became the emperor of Bhaktapur in 1696, he started the reconstruction of this palace. But, it is said that it took a time of 58 years to complete.
The palace was finally set during the reign of King Ranjit Malla in 1754 AD.  King Ranjit Malla, the son of King Bhupatindra Malla also contributed a lot to this palace. Unbearably, the tear downing earthquake of 1934 AD demolished the palace.
Despite that, the palace was remodelled, using the same windows and struts. But it was not in its usual shape. The palace once was also operated as the post office in Bhaktapur.
55 windowed palace as Bhaktapur city post office.
What’s inside the 55 window palace?
Meanwhile, one can observe the preeminent illustration of wood carvings of the Malla periods in this building. That somehow seems more attractive with black colouring. As you can observe, the first and second stories of the palace had a perfect reflection of wood carving.
The first story has doors alternating with small wood carved windows. And the second one is blessed with eleven deep carved windows in the front part. With a slanting torona over it.
You can notice the carvings of asta bhairava with his shakti. Also, the carved sculptures of Lord Ganesha and Lord Kumar in those toronas.
Besides, the walls of the first floor utter a lot about the then ruling environment. Images, that reflect the social as well as the royal lifestyles of Malla kings. That includes the wall painting of King Bhupatindra Malla himself and queen vishwo Laxmi.
Along with that, there are images of the vishwo rupa of lord bhairava with his shakti. The battleground of Ramayan. Drawings of different deities and many more. While the interior part of this palace is closed for so many years.
You may not able to see those paintings. But, roaming around this palace won’t be a waste. You still can explore wood carvings and ancient architecture.",85.428281,27.672364,Heritage Site,Nepal
68,Vatsala Durga Temple,"Vatsala Durga temple is the white elegance of Bhaktapur Durbar Square. It looks more like the Krishna Mandir of Patan but it’s not the one. It is the temple of Tantric Shakti, Durga that is established in the form of Sri Yantra.
You can see a Kalash as the representation of Vatsala Durga in the temple which was possibly possible to observe only after the quake of April 2015. Before that, the temple used to be locked and people be like totally unknown about what actually is inside this temple?
As we still wonder about the sanctum deity of the Nyatapola.
The goddess once was used to be worshipped from that locked door but today, devotees could enter there and satisfyingly worship her.
It has nine pinnacles altogether. The small ones hold the temples with images of goddesses on the first floor, for instance. Thus, terming this Vatsala Durga temple, the temple of the temples would not be inappropriate. Similarly, the pair of lions and elephants in front of the entrance particularly shows the elegance of the temple.
You can feel the intense carvings by yourself, once you touch them.
Also, there is a big barking bell in front of the temple. The anecdote says that dogs start to bark and whine when it rings. It was established there by King Bhupatindra Malla in 1721 A.D. while he renovated it.
History says King Jagat Prakash Malla started the construction of the temple in 1672 AD. But, it was completed by King jitamitra Malla in 1674 AD. King Jitmitra Malla was the son of King Jagat Prakash Malla. So, this temple holds the contributions of two Malla kings at the same time.
Actually, we can count them on three. There comes a little contribution of King Bhupatindra Malla, after all, in the beautification of the temple.

Bhagwan Chaudhary took the blame on his head to save his fellow villagers from the conviction. He was sent to the jail. The Goddess kept appearing in his dream demanding him to take her to the crime scene. She freed him from the prison and took him to the village where now there is an actual shrine of the Goddess. In return Goddess asked him to sacrifice 5 humans in every five year. Bhagwan Chaudhary being the kind man offered his own life being unable to perform human sacrifice.

394,Thupten Monastery ,"Thupten Choling Monastery is the well-known lama Trulsik Rinpoche fled from Rongbuk Gompa in Tibet to the Khumbu region during the Chinese invasion of Tibet in 1959, followed by a significant group of followers, including anis (nuns) and monks. He spent several years residing at Chiwong and other monasteries while aspiring to return to Tibet. Finally, in 1968, Rinpoche constructed Thupten Choling on donated property close to Junbesi. The monastery needed to be carefully constructed because it started to fall apart in the 1990s. After everything, he saw the location as a temporary retreat and continued to assume that he and his followers would be able to return to the homeland. However, when Chinese dominance over Tibet grew stronger and Buddhist leaders were forbidden from leaving, Rinpoche decided to establish a permanent residence at Thupten Choling in 2001.
The demolition of the ancient structures and ceremonial preparation for the new foundation marked the beginning of Thupten Choling's reconstruction. The friends of Trulsik Rinpoche provided generous financial support from Switzerland to help construct the new monastery, which Michael Schmitz planned. Mr. Schmitz and Helen Cawley, including the architecture, supply chains, and medical services, have overseen all aspects of the project. The rebuilding of the Thupten Choling monastery officially began in the year 2001.
Currently, several hundred Buddhist nuns and monks (80% of them being Tibetan refugees) live in the Thupten Choling monastery. As dozens of newcomers join the monasteries community each year, the population of the monastery only flourishes day by day.
However, the massive earthquake in April 2015 wrecked the beautiful infrastructure. This disaster caused severe damage to the ancient structures. During the rainy seasons, the monastery residents were compelled to live in tents because some of the walls had cracks in them.
The monks had requested financial assistance from Western organizations. The monastery has recently undergone a lot of necessary repairs and modernization, using solar energy for power consumption, electric cooktops for using it in the kitchen, etc.",86.5492821112275,27.6061600721939, Religious Site,Nepal
395,Bhadrakali Temple,"
Bhadrakali Temple in Kathmandu
Bhadrakali is one of the powerful goddess of Nepal. Located near the Sahid Gate at the eastern side of Tudikhel is the temple of Bhadrakali. Also known as Shree Lumadhi Bhadrakali, the temple is considered as one of the most renowned  Shaktipith  of Nepal. A form of Goddess Kali, Bhadrakali in Sanskrit means  blessed, auspicious, beautiful and prosperous  and she is also known as  Gentle Kali . Another mane for the goddess is Lazzapith.The ancient writings in the Vayu Purana and Mahabharat explain the creation of Bhdrakali by Devi s wrath when Daksha insulted Lord Shiva during the great Ashvamedha Yagya (Horse Sacrifice). Tantra Rahasya mentions her rising from the north face of Lord Shiva, (Uttaramnaya Amnayas) which is blue in color and has three eyes.

She is often believed to take on a terrible aspect that is represented with three eyes and four, twelve or eighteen hands carrying a number of weapons with flames flowing from her head and a small tusk sticking out from her mouth.

According to the myths, a farmer used to plough some nearby land and kept his food (bread) on the side. The bread used to turn into gold so the temple got its name as Lumarhi/Lumdi Devi s temple as Lumdi in Newari means  golden bread .
It was built in the year 1817 and was previously known as  Mudule Thumpko . The temple is believed to be built after Goddess Bhadrakali told the priest to dig the hill where they found the statue of the goddess. Since then, the temple lies there and is protected by Nepal Army. It overlooks the Singha Durbar, Prime Ministerial office, on the eastern side.

According to another legend, a tantric practitioner named Saswat Bajra went to Kamaru Kamachya in India and worshipped Shri Bhadrakali.

The cave was allegedly discovered in the 16th century by some local men who stumbled upon it when clearing some grass. Within the dark cave they discovered many shrines and statues dedicated to Shiva and other Hindu deities. These included Mahadev and Parvati, Nageswor and Saraswati. Towards the read of the cave the men discover that a waterfall ran through it. Further inspection revealed to them that the water fall came from Patale Chhango (later known as: Davis falls).

Outside the Gupteshwor Mahadev Cave

Before you even enter into the cave itself there are things to see. After walking through the roadside archway you ll have a dozen or so souvenir stalls to peruse. Though you will probably be better off buying in Lakeside or better yet Kathmandu. Before the ticket counter is a a round concrete balcony of sorts. It gives you a close look at the cave entrance and the statues leading up to it. After you buy you ticket you will will enter down the large spiral staircase. It s here where you ll see many modern statues and plaster works depicting everything from semi-clad ladies to bearded men and Nepali deities. There seems to be a take on some of the Kathmandu Valley s erotic carvings here as many of the sculptures are of a sensual nature.

Inside the Gupteshwor Mahadev Cave

As you enter the cave you ll discover how dark it is inside. There is lighting but it s only a series of small light bulbs. A head torch comes in handy as you descend a little to the first unusual sight. A cow shed. While primarily a religious site, the cow is a statue over a Shiva lingam. It s being developed more as a tourist attraction these days.You are free to enter inside the small little tunnel like shed. If you leave a donation you can receive a drink of milk. Though you might have to ask for it too. There is no live cow. Continuing on the 40 or so meters down the cave passing other small statues and shrines you ll come across the main Shiva temple which has a strict rule about no photography. There are guards or caretakers watching out for this. Continue on past the temple to the second part of the cave which is about 140 meters in length. Here the walls open up and you can see some nice colors in the cave walls. Further again and you ll come across a metal staircase leading downwards. You ll hear the waterfall ahead from here. This part is often closed during the monsoon season. Do be careful as the staircase and ground is quite slippery. Once you have descended the staircase you will have to walk across some uneven rocky ground until you get to an area with a view of the waterfall.",83.9572321996093,28.1894282515503, Religious Site,Nepal

Kali is one of the most powerful and dangerous forms of the Hindu Goddess Durga and is often associated with power. Goddess Kali also means   the Black one .

The king thought of keeping this beautiful idol in his own home as the beauty of the fierceful idol was too mesmerizing. The king was returning to his hometown after the marriage ceremony. The bride, groom and others from the marriage procession took shelter in the forest and slept there in the night. On the following day when they woke up in the morning there was a ruckus around them. Not a single person was able to move the idol from that step. So the King Pratap Narayan Singh Malla ordered to build the temple for the goddess in the exact same spot where the goddess had taken rest. The temple was renovated in the late 1990s with other construction of other temples such as the temple of Lord Shiva, Radha Krishna and Laxmi Narayan.",83.6135626025498,28.2554199192709, Religious Site,Nepal

While tradition once saw animal sacrifices performed within the temple grounds, a shift towards compassion has prevailed. In 2016, the sacrificial practice of pigeons was replaced by their symbolic release, a testament to the temple's embrace of a gentler, more peaceful form of devotion.

502,Shree Krishna Pranami Mandir ,"Pranami Dharma propagates monotheism. i.e. belief in one Supreme Power, Namely Poorna Brahma Sacchidanand (Satchidanand)Parmatma. The informal foundation of Pranami Dharma was laid during the Braj and Raas Leela (Krishna Leela) in Dwapar,r approximately 5000 years ago in this ephemeral world. It considers Shri Krishna of Braj and Raas leela as an embodiment of Poornabrahm Parmatma or the Supreme Lord. It was founded by Nijanand Swami Acharya Shri Devchandra ji. Hence, the religion first started as Nijanand Sampradaya and later came to be known as Shri Krishna Pranami Dharma. Nijanand also means   Nij (Self) Anand (Bliss)- Bliss of the Self. Our scripture is Tartam Sagar which is also known as Swaroop Saheb, and is a Book of REVELATIONS. It was revealed through Mahamati Prannath approximately 350-400 years ago. Mahamati Prannath ji, was the disciple of Shri Devchandra ji and He is responsible for propagation of its philosophy across Indian Subcontinent. The philosophy helps in a clear demarcation of Self (atma/soul), Overself (par-atma), Supreme Self or Supreme Lord (Parmatma) in the ethereal world and of ego, mind and body in the ephemeral world and goes on to describe the relationship between them. It helps in understanding not only how but also why - the reason- the universe and world was created. Sundarsath (as the followers of Pranami Dharma are called) follow the path of love as is between a Lover and the Beloved. This is only possible if a person is able to rise above the bodily existence and can dwell on the level of spirit/soul while remaining in the ephemeral existence. The philosophy helps in making sense of the various deities, demi-Gods and Goddesses as are expressed in Philosophy of Sanatan Dharma. It expounds on the essence of various religious scriptures of the west and goes on to show that the diversity between them is unwanted. In essence all religions talk about the Same Lord Supreme, but are called by different names. It clearly answers the following questions   Who am I? Where am I from? What is my purpose of being in this world? Who is my origin? What is the relationship with my Origin? The Sundarsath greet each other using the word Pranam, meaning I bow to the spirit in you which is the embodiment of Supreme Lord, Sat-Chid-Anand meaning Truth-Consciousness-Bliss. Any one, who can love One Lord Supreme as a Beloved, is actually following the path of a Pranami, even though, one is not aware of one s relationship with the Lord Supreme. If one gains the knowledge one has with the Lord Supreme, the ease with which one can attain Him is unparalleled. The sundarsath follow a concept of an Asht-prahar (asht-eight//prahar-consists of 3hours) seva pooja (love permeated prayer) to keep a constant awareness of the nearness to and relationship with Lord Almighty around the clock.",85.3758359514177,27.7131551223417, Religious Site,Nepal

574,Jaya Bageshwori Temple,"A miracle at the Bageshwori temple - In 1926 ( Nepali calendar 1983) Padma Kumari Devi Singh (11 yrs) who lived in Kailash Bhawan, Gharbari Tole road (Ward-2), Nepalgunj, went to pray at the Bageshwori temple as on that day she was very sad. The temple was empty and even the 'Bajes' (Brahmins) were not to be seen. She sat at the single open door of the temple closed her eyes and prayed. When she opened her eyes she saw a small child, very poor (like a beggar child) in a long ragged garment standing before her. The child said 'lah' (in nepali lah means take) and put something in Padma's palm and closed it.
When Padma opened her hand there was nothing there and when she looked up, the child had disappeared. The incident had occurred in a matter of a second. It was with the blessings of the Goddess Bageshwori that the very next day Thakur Ananda Swarup Singh (father of Padma Kumari Devi) received a proposal for her marriage which he accepted and in 1930 at Singha Durbar,Kathmandu, Padma Kumari Devi was married to Maj-Gen. Mahabir S. J. B. Rana son of Late Shri Col. Maharajkumar Prakash S. J. B. Rana (who was the maker of the Junge Mahadev temple at Nepalgunj) and grandson of Cdg. Gen. Shri Tin Maharaj Sir Bhim Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana, Maharaj of Lamjanj and Kaski, who was Prime Minister of Nepal. Since then the number of visitors in the temple has increased at a very high rate.
People believe that whatever they would wish for there, would be granted to them. With the blessings of the Goddess Bageswori, Maj. Gen. Mahabir S. J. B. Rana was Gov. of Ilam, Nepal, Gov. Dhankuta (he was the first to modernise the tea estates in the late 1930s & early 1940s), Mbr Advisory Assembly-1951, Minister for Planning & Development: 1951-1955, Mines, Electricity, Forest-1951-1953, Home-Affairs-1953-1954, Industry & Commerce-1953-1955, Agriculture & Food-1953-1955 and Civil Supplies-1953-1954, Nepal.

578,Batuk Bhairav Temple ,"Batuk Bhairabh Temple is a one storey pagoda style temple topped with a brass roof at the crossroad in Lagankhel, the heart of Patan district. Unlike other temples, this one doesn t have an idol rather a stone-shrine is worshipped as Bhairabh accompanied by Lord Ganesh, Lord Kumar and Goddess Kumari in the inner sanctum. Many believe that Batuk Bhairabh is a family deity of God Minnath. According to the legend, King Amshuvarma of Lichhavi Period built this temple after his return from Prayag visit between 595 CE   621 CE, then Juddha Shumsher Rana refurbished it in 1912 B.S.

Lord Shiva divined himself as wrathful Bhairabh to scare off Brahma and Bishnu when a dispute on who is the greatest of all erupted between these three gods. It is believed that Shiva cut off one of five heads of Brahma when he counter-argued that Brahma was the greatest for being the Creator. According to the ancient text Shakti Sangam from Kali Khanda scripture, Batuk Bhairav was born to kill the demon Aapad who gained a powerful boon from Brahma. Aapad misused his powers to create havoc in all three worlds; heaven, hell and earth. Infuriated Gods to punish the demon for his misdeeds created a five year old boy with their combined powers. The boy was Batuk Bhairabh, the living embodiment of time and space. Aapad couldn t be killed in present, past or future time zones because of his boon, so Batuk momentarily paused the Kalachakra (time), ripped Aapad s body apart and saved the entire living creature.


People worship Batuk Bhairabh to get rid of Sani Dosh, the obstacles created by the planet Saturn. Weak Saturn results in insomnia, laziness, and many physical, mental and psychological losses and not only to oneself but to immediate family members too. In easier terms, life and lifestyle go down south because of Sani Dosh. Worshipping Batuk Bhairabh on a specific day of a week for a specific number of days will help one alleviate their problems. People also feed black dogs, Bhairabh s animal form on Saturdays as a service to Him.",85.3242168389261,27.6645321392273, Religious Site,Nepal
579,Rato Machchhindranath Mandir,"The Rato Machhendranath Temple is located in a huge courtyard known as Ta Baha, about 400 meters south of Patan s (Lalitpur s) Darbar Square. The temple celebrates Machhendranath (also known as Matsyendra), an influential early 10th century yogi who recognized the god Shiva as his teacher and practiced in the Indic regions of the time. It was built in 1673 on the foundations of earlier temples that had stood here since the 15th century. The temple is a towering Newar-style pagoda with three layers of declining roofs in its physical structure. Sheet metal (possibly copper) covers the roof surfaces, which are supported by 20 struts on the first and second levels, and twelve struts on the upper level. Avalokitevara is shown in a variety of stances on each of the 52 struts, typically with one or more extra sets of arms. There are miniature vignettes depicting scenarios from Buddhist hells, such as boiling alive, on the bottom registers of the struts, beneath Avalokitevara s feet. Other vignettes are of a gentler tone, with lesser deities supporting Avalokitevara on pedestals. The front-facing side (here, the north) is adorned with a huge variety of pots and pans mounted to tables, seemingly defying gravity, as is the case with many Newar pagodas. A lengthy pataka strip hangs from the temple s top to practically ground level in front of it, allowing Machhendranath/Avalokitevara to descend to earth.",85.3228765726089,27.6703403488174, Religious Site,Nepal

586,Ugrachandi Mandir,"The charming Ugrachandi Mandir, which is also known as Tamakhdyah, lies in the local tole of Patan. This square, four-storey temple with a hip roof made of flat sheets has an air of mystery. The first recorded mention of the temple is from 1702 CE, but its true age is not known. 

Inside, the temple houses the fierce goddess Ugrachandi, the mother deity of the Tamrakar clan. Hence, this gives the temple its Newar name, Tamakahdyah which means  the goddess of Tamkrakars . According to legend, she was brought from Kathmandu to Patan through tantric magic. 

The goddess is still revered in this modern age. Despite holding its ancient religious values, many physical changes have been added to this ancient site. In 1756 and 1761 a beautiful wooden torana was added to the temple. Today, an iconic stone under a copper torana in the sanctum represents Ugrachandi exuding divine peace.

The divinity of this temple is kept alive by various rituals and worship. A Newar Upadhyaya Brahmin conducts daily rituals, supported by the Tamrakar community. Various Tamkrakar Guthi (local Newari communities) involve themselves by sponsoring different religious events at this temple.

Among these events, key activities of the shrine include the regular Ugrachandi worship. This occurs between the full moon of the month Baishakh and the sixth day of the brighter half of the month Jestha. Here also occurs the grand Tahguthi Puha with animal sacrifice and a community feast. 
These vibrant rituals and ceremonies breathe life into the temple, making it not just a structure of stone and wood but a living symbol of the Tamrakar people's faith and culture.

It is perhaps the second most popular attraction in Patan after Patan Durbar Square. The temple was built in 1409 and is in fact a Newari Buddhist monastery. The name  golden temple  came about through tourism and a shortening of it s translation more than it actually being made of pure gold. Most of the temple is actually polished gilt copper which gives it a fantastic golden shine. Inside the main courtyard there are probably enough artifacts to keep most historians happy for a full day. Please note that that leather items are not permitted inside temple.Golden Temple (Kwa Bahal) in Patan
Hiranya Varna Mahavihar or Golden Temple is only a five-minute walk from Patan Durbar Square in Lalitpur. Yet many people in the immediate neighborhood and Kathmandu don t know about it. Though named Golden Temple, it is actually a Buddhist monastery with gilded metal plates covering most of its frontage. The monastery has a ticketing service of fifty rupees for foreigners. When asked what about the Golden Temple appeals to them, a foreign couple said,  We are fascinated by the architecture of this closed courtyard Buddhist monastery which is unique. The carvings have a lot of detail. And, it is so peaceful. This three-roof monastery was built in the 12th Century by King Bhaskar Verma and is adorned with a golden facade, four large gateways, a clock tower, and two lion sculptures. The main priest here is only twelve years old, replaced after a month of service. The place is a serene getaway from the hustle and bustle of the busy Patan alleys.

600,Hasapota Ganesh Mandir,"Housed along the road from Jhamiskhel to Bakundol, the Hasapota Ganesh Temple stands as a beacon of devotion and history. This sacred shrine, established during the illustrious Malla era, venerates Ganesh as one of the principal deities of the Newars. With its statue facing the west, it symbolizes an ancient connection to the spiritual and temporal realms.

The chronicles of its renovation are meticulously inscribed on the right side of the temple. You will find inscriptions recounting restorations from the years 2001 B.S. and 2033 B.S. The temple's current incarnation owes its existence to the Hasapota Ganesh Dharmik Byabasta Samiti, who rebuilt it with reverence in 2075 B.S.

A myth whispers through the ages, telling of a saint from Lhasa who meditated deeply at this site, dreaming of constructing the ""Hasapota Palace."" His untimely death left his vision unfulfilled, but his devotion transformed the place into a revered sanctuary known as ""Lhasa Hasapota."" Over time, this name evolved, giving the temple its current identity. This tale hints at a historical reverence among Buddhists, adding a rich layer to its spiritual tapestry.

Remnants of the Lichchhavi era still linger in the temple's precincts. Here idols of Nawadurga and a sacred Shiva Linga find their home. Behind the temple, an artistic Sattal structure stands as a testament to the architectural beauty of the past. On the right, a complex dedicated to religious bhajans invites devotees to lose themselves in melodic worship.

Among the many rituals and festivals celebrated here, the Dipankar Yatra stands out. The festival is primarily a part of Hiranyabarna Mahabihar. However, it weaves together the vibrant tapestry of the culture of both Hiranyabarna Mahabihar and Hasapota Ganesh Temple.

This temple, steeped in myth and history, stands as a symbol of unwavering devotion, a bridge between the past and present. It is a sacred space where the divine continues to inspire and uplift all who enter its hallowed grounds.

Its grandeur is emphasized by a singular rectangular base. Two stone lions stand guard at the entrance, symbols of strength and protection. On the western wall, a beautiful colonnaded opening and a door await those seeking divine blessings.

The temple honors Bhimsen or Bhindya?, who is revered as the deity of trade among the Newars. The temple is honored as one of Patan Durbar Square's eight treasures. Lalitpur, famed for its fine arts, houses four main Bhimsen temples. Among these Bhimsen temples, the Bhinddyolakshi temple is considered the oldest one.  Each has its own story and importance, reflecting the lasting devotion to this revered deity.  

Along with its religious significance, the temple also reflects the fine artistry of the Newars. The surface view of the temple in itself is quite grand and easy to notice. However, inside the temple. various shrines of revered deities can be found. When you enter the temple, a stone staircase ascends towards a sanctum where Bhimasena's statue stands. Nearby, statues of Draupadi, Bhairava, and Kali add vibrancy to the temple's ambiance.

Most of the temple's origin s history remains veiled in mystery. Yet, some documentation tells of its reconstruction in 1682 by Shrinivas Malla, rising from the ashes of a fierce fire. Through tremors in 1934 and 1967, it endured a lot of damage yet stood resilient. Despite the scars of the 2015 quake, its doors reopened in 2022 after reconstruction in its ancient form.

627,Tilaurakot,"It was in the ancient city of Kapilavastu that Prince Siddhartha was raised from his birth until the age of 29. This was the capital of the ancient Sakya Kingdom, where the prince was treated to a lavish life of luxury   a way of life that he would ultimately reject to begin his spiritual journey.

When he was 29 years old, Prince Siddhartha left through the eastern gate of Kapilavastu, to start the path to enlightenment as Buddha. Today, you can stand in this exact same spot and look out through the gate, onto the green fields that saw the first steps of this epic journey. This moment has become an important part of modern spiritual journeys.

The remains of the ancient capital are in modern-day Tilaurakot and much of them have been excavated and restored, while archaeological work is still taking place to uncover even more parts of the city and insights into the life of Siddhartha Gautama.

As a major civic centre from about the 9th century BC until the 3rd century AD, there would once have been many grand buildings here. Already, experts have uncovered palace structures, temples, roads and ponds. Some of the artefacts that have been found during excavations are on display at the nearby Kapilavastu Museum.
Tilaurakot is also an important site for Hinduism and you ll notice a rustic modern Hindu temple dedicated to the deity Samai Mai within the ancient walls, where people regularly come to worship.
As you walk through the site at Tilaurakot, you ll get a sense of the scale of the city where Buddha grew up   but you ll also appreciate how isolated he was here, protected by his father. It s not hard to imagine how, as a young prince, he would have looked beyond the walls of Kapilavastu and felt there was something deeper that he needed to uncover.

640,Nepal Folk Musical Instrument Museum,"The founder of the museum, Kadel is not a musician himself but a genuine admirer of the musical traditions. His dedication to his passion has driven him to keep up with his collection and sustain the cultural heritage. The museum now showcases 655 distinct Nepali folk musical instruments among more than 1350 from all over the country. The impressive fact about this museum is that all the musical instruments are either bought or newly made by the local artisans. No instrument is taken from any place where artists still play them. Only those, which are not in use are brought and kept in the museum. That way, the local artists can continue playing live music, keeping up the vibrance of the melodies. 
Folk music is not much in practice these days, which makes it a priority to save them. If it is forgotten, it is not just the music that we lose; we lose our culture, we lose our history. The folk musical instruments are simple, made from whatever is found from the surrounding. Inspired by the sound of nature: the waterfalls, blowing of the wind, mooning of cattle, chirping of birds, even the shape of the instruments is influenced by the nature. The Hiti Manga, for instance, is a fine replica of the water spouts in Kathmandu, producing music similar to the sound of water filled in a pot from the spout.

It takes about 30 minutes to drive from Kathmandu to Doleshwar. For all Shiva enthusiasts, a trip to Kedarnath is not complete unless they visit Doleshwor Mahadeva and Pashupatinath.
A pilgrimage to these three sacred spots is thought to wash away all of one’s sins and provide an opportunity to receive heavenly blessings from Lord Shiva.
Shree 1008 Jagat Guru Bheemashaankarling Shivacharya, the top priest of Kedarnath, officially designated Doleshwor Mahadev as the head of Kedarnath, one of the Char Dham Yatra, on August 22, 2009.
For the last 4,000 years, the general population was unaware of the connection between Kedarnath and Doleshwor.
Looking back at Doleshwor Mahadev’s history, it is claimed that after the Mahabharata of Kurushetra, the Pandav brothers headed for the Himalayas in seek of Lord Shiva’s pardon for the deaths of many people during the conflict.
But, because Lord Shiva was unwilling to forgive them, he disguised himself as a bull. Knowing about Lord Shiva’s disguise as the fleeing bull, the Pandavas captured the tail of the bull, at which point the head of the bull became split from the remainder of the body.
The remaining body is thought to be in Kedarnath, India’s Uttarakhand state and people have been looking for the head since then.
After a severe flood damaged the temple of Kedarnath in Uttarkhand in 2013, the regular prayers that had been stopped were carried out in Doleshwor Temple. The head priest of the Kedarnath Temple requested that regular prayers be held in the Doleshwar Mahadev Temple instead of the Kedarnath Temple.",85.4362204,27.6388668,Monument,Nepal
720,Maha Manjushree Temple (Saraswatisthan or Lhasapakhe),"Each year, during Shree Panchami, a large number of devotees follow in their footsteps at Saraswatisthan or the Maha Manjushree temple, located at Bagishwori, Nagarkokt Road-Bhaktapur. It might be a coincidence but yes there exist the two famous temples of Bhaktapur.
Saraswotisthan
One among them is the temple of Goddess Saraswoti and another is of the Maha Manjushree. Because of this, people seem to have a little confusion regarding the different names of the same place.
Mahamanjushree temple
Besides, Saraswotisthan and Maha Manjushree temples, that place is also called Lashapake (Lhasapako), Ratnagiri, Mahamandapgiri, and sometimes Thakalmath danda. One can witness the beautiful religious harmony over there among the Buddhist and Hindu religions.
There is not much information about the establishment of the Saraswoti temple but there is an interesting story related to the Maha Manjushree temple.
Mahamanjushree Temple
According to the chronology of Nepal, when Mahamanjushree came to Kathmandu Valley to exalt self-enlightened Swayambhu in Tretayuga, he is said to have resided in Thakalmath danda (Maha Manjushree Danda).
And, after that, he went to outlet the water of Naagdaha (serpent’s living lake) by cutting the gorges of Guheswari, Chobhar, and Katuwal with his Chandrahas Sword.
He is claimed to have settled the Kathmandu Valley after cutting the gorges. In our history books, he is also credited with founding the city of Manjupattan and erecting the throne of a monarch named Dharmakar, indicating that he was already of prehistoric importance.
Accordingly, his activities like staying and meditating at some particular place relatively have to have phenomenal importance. That’s why this place has both religious and historical importance. Besides, it delivers a great view of the Kathmandu Valley, although it is quite quashed with smoke and dust.
Mahamanjushree danda
Since the place was reverenced as Maha Manjushree’s cave, several Buddhist sages and Siddhas are believed to have visited this place. One of them was the great Poet and Buddhist master ‘Milarepa’ from the 11 – 12th century. It is believed that he visited the place at the invitation of the king from Kathmandu valley.
This is one of the important power places for Buddhist practitioners with great positive vibrations.

Again, there is one more belief that every devotee, perhaps, believes in. It is said that in the cave of Maha Manjushree (very well known as the temple of Maha Manjushree), a sound of blowing wind comes and that wind is believed to be coming from Lhasa.
Lhasa, from where Maha Manjushree, himself is believed to have come from.

There are two major Mahalaxmi temples in Madhyapur Thimi. One in Bode and another, over here at Madhyapur which is located around 250m ahead (east) from Digu Bhairava Temple of Digu Tole. It is one of the important pilgrims of Thimi. Considerably, it is one among the Astamatrikas of Madhyapur Thimi.
For many years, the deities of the temple were represented by stones. Later, the full-fledged faces of concerning deities were added over there. The statue of Vishnu and Laxmi, Mahadeva, Mahalaxmi, Mahakali Bhairava and others.

There is an unshaped stone image of kumari and her mount peacock in front of the temple. Moreover, the struts of the temple over here depicts the erotic carvings, quite similar to the temple of Dattatraya.

This temple might be the only temple in the entire thimi which has its own green parks. And that thing certainly attracts a lot of visitors. However, people also gather here to celebrate jatras after the tongue piercing festival. During Balkumari Jatra, the seven of the palanquins are whirled over here. With that, the place is also used to conduct different rituals like Bartabanda. It is actually a compulsory activity to do puja over there while doing Bartabanda (for the locals only).
Recently some new formations and restorations have been completed over there. The making of pati, Dabali and the stone-paved courtyard was done in 2077.

Digu tole, a locality of thimi where people spent their days moulding clays and turning them into an elegant flower vase. The entire courtyard fills with those incomplete clay crafts during sunny days. And in rainy seasons, they simply make a plastic tent over those clay crafts.
Stopping by Digu bhairava temple and turning toward the west would ultimately lead you toward this pottery square.

On the northern side of the square, there is a small temple of Gorakhnath. But one should reach the ending point of that short path to be there. And, as expected you can find both incomplete and complete clay vases all over the temple premises too.

This pilgrim is meant as holy as the Gosaikunda. Locals even believe that the water over here comes directly from Gosaikunda.

The statue of Shileshwor Mahadev
In 2074, the statue of sleeping Shiva and other 64 Pancha Mukhi Shivalingas were added there. Before this, there were already stone footprints of Laxmi and Narayan. A chaitya was assumed to be made when Samrat Ashoka visited Nepal.

Within that little dense jungle, there is a temple of Adi Ganesh that locally is worshipped as Chonga Ganesh temple.
It is said that when local women make ‘raksi’, the local homemade liqueur, they come and worship at this temple, offering Ganesh some of the local brews.
Also, this Chonga Ganesh temple is counted among those three Ganesh temples of Bhaktapur which create a magical triangle that forms an outer ring of a Mandala. Symbolically, it protects Bhaktapur. The centre of this mandala is said to be either the Taleju Temple in Durbar Square or the Tripursundari Temple located near Sukhudhwakha.
This fact is depicted in the Shri Yantra Mandala, a Newar painting from the 19th century. The painting is still safe on the first floor of the National Art Museum of Bhaktapur Durbar Square.
However, as already mentioned, the Chonga Ganesh temple premises is now more famous for picnics. Each Saturday, the place gets filled with people since it has a good space in between the woods of Salla. Because of those trees of Salla, this place is also called Sallaghari.

Sallaghari and the Chonga Ganesh Temple is not far from Bhaktapur Durbar Square. If you want to go there, then you can simply take a bus from either Dudhpati (Shiddhapokhari) or Sano Byasi (Tourist Bus Park). It would approximately take 5 min to 10 min to reach there by bus, regarding from where you would take the bus.
Or, you could simply have a walk which would take around 20-25 min from Bhaktapur Durbar Square. The site lies in the western part of the Bhaktapur. It is further recognized as the linking point of three municipalities (Bhaktapur, Madhyapur Thimi and Suryabinayak).

726,Hanuman Ghat (Khorhe) of Bhaktapur,"Hanuman ghat (value for the people of Bhaktapur)
Early in the morning, the denizens of Bhaktapur city roam all possible temples around them. But, during the month of poush and magh (Madhav Narayan mela) from the full moon day of Poush till another, they all destined to one destination. It’s no other than Hanuman ghat.
It flows through the rural and urban areas of the Bhaktapur district before joining the Manohara River at Jadibuti in Kathmandu.
madhav narayan mela at Hanuman ghat
Locals, in their own language call this place khorhe. However, this place is quite similar to the Pashupatinath too, in terms of having a cremation expanse along with the sack of temples. 
There are significant places of Sitala Mai, Hanuman, Mata Bhagwati, Badrinath, draupati Bhimsen, and Astamatrika. Along with them, there is a huge Shivalinga installed outside the entrance. Some beautiful statues of Buddha, Ganesh, and Ram Sita are also established over there.

Hanumanghat, locally called ‘Khorhen’ by the locals is located at the confluence of two rivers, namely, Brahmayeni Khola River flowing from the north-east side and Tabyakhusi Khola River flowing from the south-east side. The river carries the name Hanumante only downstream of the confluence of these two rivers.
The image of Ram Sita at hanuman ghat
There is a belief with regards to the religious importance of Hanumanghat, Hanumanghat is considered to be located at Tribeni (confluence of three rivers) of Bira, Bhadra, and Tamasa. To them, Bira is Brahmayeni Khola River Bhadra is Tabyakhusi Khola River and the river Tamasa is coming out from the ground.
Image of Ganesh at Hanuman ghat
Besides all of these temples and statues, there is one beautiful statue of Budanilkantha. People worshipped it as Bhujasi Narayan. The statue is said to be transferred over there from one of the courtyards of 99 courtyards of Bhaktapur Durbar Square, after the earthquake of 1990.
Considering all these facets of Hanuman Ghat, it could easily be sanctioned as a religious pilgrim.  While, on the other hand, because it has a cremation area, many people avoid going there at night.
Ghats are said to be an abode of ghosts, evil spirits, fierce deities, and tantric. That’s why it sounds quite scarier too.
hanuman ghat
Ghat is a Nepalese word that means the cremation area. Also, one of the features of ghats is being situated near rivers or Triveni. This, Hanuman ghat is also blessed with Triveni. Triveni generally means the confluence of three rivers. Near Hanuman ghat, a river named Bira ( streamed from Jagati), along with another river named Bhadra (running from Maheshwari) collide with the third river named Tamasa.
It is also believed that the Tamasa river does not pass from elsewhere instead the origin of this river is said to be this pilgrimage, Hanuman ghat itself.
Hanuman ghat during monsoon
Well, there is an interesting story regarding its orientation. As per which, when Lord Ram along with Sita and Hanuman was returning from the after-battle at Lanka, he paused at this place. After some rest and bath, they sat on a stone near the river and started to have fruits.
Meanwhile, Hanuman was in a jittery situation, thinking about sharing foods from the same plate as his master’s. He, in any situation, could not let his master eat the same food touched by his Jhuto hands.
(Jhuto means impure in the Nepalese language. While you are eating, your hands are assumed Jhuto until you washed them. Thus, while eating you are not allowed to enter the Kitchen, temple and another restricted area in Nepal.) 
To resolve his inner dilemma, he founded a new origin of Ganga beneath his tail which we call the Tamasa river nowadays. With the pure water of Ganga, he used to wash his hands each time he took a bite from the plate.
You can imagine, that scene must be quite hilarious. Washing hands beneath the tail that each time when you have a bite. When Lord Ram noticed this interlude, he asked Hanuman that why is he acting this weird just like a typical monkey. 
Which after, Hanuman explained all his dilemmas and deeds. Seeing Hanuman’s this devotion, lord Ram then hugged him tightly. It is said that after that incident the place was started to call Hanuman ghat though.
astamatrika at Hanuman ghat
However, people still believe that one time in a day, Hanuman appears to bathe over there. And, during that time, the way toward this ghat seems vanished or clouded.
Well, that one was an interesting story associating with Ramayan. Moreover, there is one more darn which states that the statue of Balmikeshwor Mahadev of Khorhe was erected by the Balmiki himself. Balmiki is that person who is revered as the author of Ramayana.

727,Mahankal Trishul Danda,"Trishul Danda is one of the emerging destinations of Bhaktapur. Though it plainly is a hill station allaying the Changunarayan temple in the northern hills of Bhaktapur, it has both historical and religious importance to have arisen as a tourism destination. 
The spot is a little height thus, it provides a good illustration of both the Himalayas and terraced Bhaktapur Nagara. Well, it provides a panoramic view of around 20 different mountains. Besides that, it gives one of the best views of the Kathmandu valley, including Nagarkot, Sankhu, and Shivapuri hill stations. 
Changu-Trishul danda
Moreover, there is also news regarding the making of a huge trident over there. Around 121 feet high since the destination is already on-air as Trishul Danda.

Out of so many temples why Goraknath?
The actual Gorakhnath temple was Built by Prithvi Narayan Shah and was dedicated to Gorakhnath who was a famous Yogi who traveled widely across India. It is situated ten meters down the southern side of Gorkha Palace. 
Perhaps, because of some connections of King Prithivi Narayan Shah to this place, the concerned people are making Goraknath temple over here. They say that when King Prithvi Narayan Shah was having ease taking five villages, viz., Panauti, Banepa, Nala, Khadpu, and Sanga, he returned to Nuwakot via Changu.
During that journey, he is said to have stayed at Trishul Danda. During his stay, he found that this place is worth making a fort, allowing him to have an eye on the entire Kathmandu Valley. Thus, he made a fort there named Mulkot fort just like the Ranikot fort.
Since the story goes far as there are rumors it is said that he had planned to attack Kathmandu Valley from this fort. In the meantime, it is said that he worshipped Mahankal very ascetically. Hence, this might be one reason behind calling this place Mahankal Trishul Danda as well.
The Trishul danda means the hill station named by the Trident of Lord Shiva but it is more familiar to the locals as the Mahankal Trishul danda. There are more people who even perform their annual Kuldevata puja over there.
There are two natural Shiva Lingam, a tall Trishul, a temple of Shree Santoshi Mata, an idol of Shree Panchamukhi Hanuman, an Ashram of Trishul Baba, a view tower, a Peepal tree, and four-faced Shiva Lingam surrounded by a beautiful garden.

About the naming of the temple, there is one darn adopted by all. In Hindu pilgrim, Surya means the sun who is also worshipped as a god and it is widely believed that the first ray of the sun directly touches the feet of this image of Binayak or the Ganesh.

The physical evidence of the temple states that it was built in the early 17th century. That somehow points to the fact that it was built during the reign of King Bhupatindra Malla. Some rumours also state that it was built by King Vishnu Dev Barma while some say it is old enough to declare its age more than a thousand-year.

There is another interesting folk related to the creation of the forest including the arise of Suryabinayak himself. As per the priest of the temple, when Hanuman was hurrying up to transfer the hill full of medicinal herbs while he was unaware of one medicinal herb named Sanjibani Buti, a small piece of that hill was fall and thus turns down as the hill of Surya Binayak.
If you are well aware of the story of Ramayana, then you could probably be well aware of this incident as well. Coincidently, the hill of Suryabinayak is also full of medicinal herbs.
The temple of Mother Goddess
Aligning with the temple of Suryabinayak temple, there is one more temple, a few steps above the main shrine of Suryabinayak temple. It is called the temple of the mother goddess. As per the locals, it is the temple of the mother of Lord Ganesh. That’s why it is also called Shiva Parvati temple (the parents of Lord Ganesh).

For the reason that it is situated quite far from the Bhaktapur Durbar Square, most people prefer to visit this place at least. However, being the ultimate square to be visited too, it again gives a bunch of surprises to its visitors. This square is named after the Dattatraya temple, where Dattatraya, a part of the trinity is worshipped. 
Dattatraya temple
As the other squares of Bhaktapur, this sort of place is also filled with minor and major temples. If you walk north from this temple, you’ll see a Salan Ganesh temple and behind it a giant manmade pond dedicated to Lord Ganesh. The pond is called Ganesh pokhari.
Salan Ganesh Temple and the pond
Within the area of Dattatraya Square, there are three more temples that hold both cultural and religious paramount. Among them,  this Salan Ganesh Temple has immense importance. During different festivals and events like Gai jatra, the temple is embraced by the devotees.
Salan Ganesh temple
The temple holds an image of Lord Ganesh, but, yes, it is not a sculpture. And that thing makes it quite unique from others. The image is rooted in a natural stone that has a symbolic form of Ganesha or the elephant-headed image. The Salan Ganesh is also sub-titled as the Adhi Ganesh among the asta Ganesh. Sumerialy, it dates back to 1654. 
The pond behind the Salan Ganesha Temple is said to be dedicated to the temple. That’s why it is named the Ganesha pokhari. Some people somehow also called it Yatachhen pukhu. Consequently, the eve made this pond fill with young people as well as the old ones.
Salan Ganesh pokhari
There is another temple in front of the Dattatraya temple, named after the bhimsen temple. Bhimsen is said to be the god of trade. 
Bhimsen temple and the pokhari
There are still several temples and heritage sites in Bhaktapur which has no evidence of their existence. Yet, they are standing in front of us, secreting their history somewhere else. No one accurately knows about it. In those dusting and busts, the erection of the Bhimsen temple also got faded.
Bhimsen Temple
Somehow, archaeologists presume, it was erected in 1605 CE. This two-floored rectangular pagoda locates right in front of the Dattatreya Temple. Plus, it was renovated lately, by the year 2018.
As the name of the temple assumes, it is the temple of lord Bhimsen. Bhimsen, a god with a red face, angry eyes, and a thick dark moustache. He is worshipped as the god of trade and commerce. Perhaps, because of that, every household has had its portrait, especially in the Kathmandu Valley.

With the temple, a conduit is attached, right in its back. That is a conduit but it is denoted as a pond. That’s why that conduit is called Bhimsen pokhari. Meanwhile, there are no shreds of evidence about this conduit too.
Laxmi Narayan temple
An ever-closed small temple of the premises of Dattatraya temple is the temple of Laxmi Narayan Temple. The temple is dedicated to Lord Narayan and Goddess Laxmi. The temple locates in the northern core of the square.
Laxminarayan temple
These temples had their consequences, besides these temples, two more things made this square so valuable, The woodcarving museum and the brass and bronze museum.
These museums have a large collection of woodcarvings as well as metal craftsmanship of the ancient Bhaktapur kingdom respectively.
Brass and bronze Museum
Brass and Bronze museum
The museum next to the woodcarving museum was also math. The then math, which is now representing a bunch of cases, is all related to the metalwork. And it comes under the name of Brass and Bronze Museum. However, one can enter this museum with the same ticket bought either in the National Art Gallery or the Woodcarving Museum.
The museum is filled with ancient exemplars. Just like the other museum does. But, it significantly has preserved the traditional metalworks. That includes the ceremonial lamps as well as the ritual vessels, which also make it unique from others. In some summon, it is also facing the problems of weaker lighting means.
Wood Carving Museum
Woodcarving museum
The then pujari math of Tachupal Chowk now is a more renowned museum of Bhaktapur. The wood carving museum, which originally came into existence during the reign of King Yakshya Malla. With the most epigraphic temple of Bhaktapur, The Dattatraya Temple.
After the blessing of King Yakshya Malla, it was by some means rebuilt in 1763. And again renovated by the German experts as the wedding gift to the then King Birendra in 1979.
The peacock window, being the most alluring woodcraft from the 15th century, even today made us come for it. A narrow street facing south leads to this masterpiece. However, it also had to face adversity like catching fire.
The museum, of course, with the dark rooms and brazen woodcraft showcases the then wood carvings. Nearby, there are some mini souvenir shops with miniature wooden peacock windows. And the brass and bronze museum to share the ticket, for instance. However, the earthquake of 2015 made the museum quite terrible.
But, it’s worthy enough to widen your eyes for the classics.
Peacock window
There is again one spectacular thing left behind in all these things, the very famous peacock window. You need to adopt a narrow street to reach that place, where you can slacken and peacefully adore the decorative window. Don’t get confused, it’s in the same building as a woodcarving museum.
All you need to do is get out of the museum, then head east, passing the souvenir shop just turn right. And there you go. Cheer your chin up and there is it, the world-famous peacock window.
Dattatraya Temple
Dattatraya temple is one of the oldest temples of Bhaktapur which dates back to the 14th century. And, it is the central attraction of the Square.
The temple is way more unique. Though it is the only temple of Dattatraya in Nepal, it also is acclaimed for its significant architecture. Devotees from all around the nation come and worship there.

About the Latarambeshwor Temple
Well, the architecture of the temple is recently concluded, which really is so fascinating.
It is said that it took about eighteen years to complete this structure of the temple. At first, the locals, by themselves collected the money to build the temple which later on was supported by the local government and thus this outstanding result came out.
It is an open temple, but unlike other temples that you find in Bhaktapur, it seems a little distinct. The foremost part of the temple is erected using bricks, even in those segments where normally, the wood is used like, in the windows.
The seven pinnacles and other miniature statues of Ganesha, Durga, and Saraswati on whirls of the temple give you a vibe of peacefulness and a complete shrine.

Kalamasi is a very petite agriculture-based village which by acquisitions comes under the Changunarayan Municipality. But it loves to be designated as a village that endures under the western lap of Nagarkot.
The village stays far away from the hustle and bustle of the Kathmandu Valley and is still managing its purity. There are still village settlements, agriculture, and nature, foremost. 
Within the periphery of Kalamsi, there are many more renowned sites of Bhaktapur like the Saraswati temple (the locals of Bhaktapur call it Lashapakhe ), where every year Hindu devotees come to worship Goddess Saraswati and Buddhist comes to Worship Maha Manjushri. 
Along with that, there is Muhan Pokhari, one of the finest weekend destinations which as a matter of the season, blanks out in the winter season. Yet it is quite popular among today’s generations.
In between these tranquil, there is Kalamasi, which has one of the best gifts of nature, the bojini dam and picnic spot.
Historical background of the Kalamasi lake
Bojii dam site was a small pond then and a capacious playground. According to the local people, it was a tremendous place with no use at all. There were no fields nor it was used for any other purpose. So, it used to be called Bajo Jamin. Synonymously, it means a free grassland.
Later on, Bajo Jamin transmitted it into Bojini. And came to existence as the Bojini Damsite and Picnic Spot. However, it is also titled the hidden lake of Nagarkot.
Archeologically, there is no important historical background of the destination. Besides, it was a small village before and momentarily too. But a shred of evidence and a word of the local somehow connects it with history. As per the inquiry, there used to be a grinding mill near the bojini pond. There is no exact conformity but it is said that the grinding mill was built after the then ruling queen ordered it to do so. A specific study might analyze whether it was made in the king’s ruling or Rana’s ruling era.
Furthermore, the present dam site area and the then Bojini pond was a natural swimming pool. The local people used it as a natural pool while foraging to the cows and other domestic animals.

The legends
If there is a major religious site in Nepal that has no mythology associated with it, then you must be missing something. Yes, in Nepal, it is so obvious that every holy place has at least one story related to its emergence.
And this is where the story of Changu begins…
According to the legend, once a brahmin named Sudarshan traded out his cow to a cow herder (gwala). When the gwala bought her, he started to graze her in the champak forest because of the good availability of green grasses and plants over there.
He had a thought as if he fed her good grasses, she’ll honour him with a good amount of milk. But, that thing anonymously never happens to him. He continued grazing her in the forest. But, the result wasn’t satisfying for him. He always got a tiny portion of milk.
He was so disappointed, thus decided to call Brahmin Sudarshan. As soon as the gwala call him, Sudarshan gave his attendance at the gwala’s place where the gwala describes all his problems to the brahmin. Considering the words of gwala, both of them decide to go and check out the activities of the cow.
As per the planning, they followed the cow while grazing. Surprisingly, they saw a very unnatural incident. They saw a black shaded boy egressing out of an old champak tree and drinking the milk from the cow.
After observing all these things, there were sure that the boy is no human. Perhaps they think he could be the devil. That’s why they decided to cut down that tree from where he egressed and did so. But, the tree starts to bleed as they cut it.
That incident made them so anxious that they started to cry aloud and asked for forgiveness. In the meantime, Lord Vishnu or the Narayan appeared in front of them and explained everything about these incidents.
He explained that he was cursed when he accidentally murdered the Sudarshan’s father during his hunt. He was tugged over there since then. And, forthwith was freed from all his sins, because of them.
Subsequently, hearing all these things, they finally got some relief on their faces. Afterwards, they established a small temple in that arena and worshipped it as the Changu Narayan temple. Where the descendants of Sudarshan brahmin continues to become priest and descendants of the gwala continues to be guthiyars.

Another legend says that there was a dense setup of Tamang people in Chaling and they used to bring/eat meat from Tibbet and Kavrepalanchowk but the skin of such animals was traded in the valley. In their language (In the language of Tamang people), the work of chopping and cleaning animal skin is called Chali. And, from the word, Chali the place is started to call Chaling.
Moreover, there is one more legend left. As per which, the local of that place used to cattle a lot of buffalo. But there was not a good market available for dairy products. That’s why they used to serve the cream that flows over the milk while boiling the milk to their guests.

1149,As-Salt - The Place of Tolerance and Urban Hospitality,"<p>Built on three closely-spaced hills in the Balqa highland of west-central Jordan, the city of As-Salt, was an important trading link between the eastern desert and the west. During the last 60 years of the Ottoman period, the region prospered from the arrival and settlement of merchants from Nablus, Syria, and Lebanon who made their fortunes in trade, banking, and farming. This prosperity attracted skilled craftsmen from different parts of the region who worked on transforming the modest rural settlement into a thriving town with a distinctive layout and an architecture characterized by large public buildings and family residences constructed of local yellow limestone. The site’s urban core includes approximately 650 significant historic buildings exhibiting a blend of European Art Nouveau and Neo-Colonial styles combined with local traditions. The city’s non-segregated development expresses tolerance between Muslims and Christians who developed traditions of hospitality evidenced in Madafas (guest houses, known as Dawaween) and the social welfare system known as Takaful Ijtimai’. These tangible and intangible aspects emerged through a melding of rural traditions and bourgeois merchants’ and tradespeople’s practices during the Golden Age of As-Salt’s development between 1860s to 1920s. </p>",35.7283055556,32.0426111111,Cultural,Jordan

This place became a site of pilgrimage for the three monotheistic religions: Judaism, Christianity and Islam. The town was sited at the crossroads of trade routes for caravans travelling between southern Palestine, Sinai, Eastern Jordan and the north of the Arabian Peninsula. Although the subsequent Ottoman Period (1517-1917) heralded an extension of the town to the surrounding areas and brought numerous architectural additions, particularly the raising of the roof level of houses to provide more upper stories, the overall Mamluk morphology of the town is seen to have persisted with its hierarchy of areas, quarters based on ethnic, religious or professional groupings, and houses with groups of rooms organized according to a tree-shaped system.</p>",35.1088888889,31.5241666667,Cultural,Palestine
