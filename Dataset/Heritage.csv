The most unusual aspect of its building is that, unlike any other wooden window, it has a window constructed of clay. That window is also known as Tellikata jhyal, which translates to “clay window.”
The architecture is said to be 318 years old, which corresponds to the age of the Nyatapola temple.
Furthermore, the architecture was recently rebuilt and launched. This is the second time it has been renovated. It is reported that it was initially renovated after the 1990 earthquake.
However, there appear to be planning to showcase it as one of Bhaktapur’s museums."

This Mahavihar is the place where both the Panchara (Pancha dan) and Samyak Mahadan begin. During Mohani, a kumari is also set up in front of this Vihar. All of this just demonstrates the location’s antiquity and historical significance.
Moreover, during Panchadan, all five Dipankar buddhas are welcomed at Aadipadma Mahaihar after gathering at Suryamandhi’s dabali (platform). Only after which, does the panchadan procedure begin.
The Vihar is located in Suryamadhi’s Taulachhen tole. Suryamadhi’s south-western corner has a short alley that leads directly to the vihar."

Legend has it that when Lichhavi King Narendra Deva was ready to introduce Rato Machhindranatha (Lord Karunamaya) to Nepal, it was determined to establish one of the three designated locations. The contemporary Lokeshwor temple, Silu Mahadeva (Phasidegal), and Aankha Bahal were those three locations.
These locations are claimed to have been picked by a bird who was thought to be Lord Karunamaya’s emissary. The entire procedure was carried out under the auspices of tantrism.
As a result, these sites were regarded as the holiest. When the task of establishing Karunamaya was not completed, Baladeva, King Narendra Deva’s son, established a Padmapani Lokeshwor there.
Padmapani Lokeshwor is a Hindu god who appears to always be holding a lotus in his palm. He is also known as the Lashkar dyo (Laska dyo) and Bhaktapur’s Karunamaya.
The Jet Varna vihar is another name for it. It has Gaju Chaityas, Khamba Chaityas, Bajra Khatu Chaityas, Dharma Khatu, Vimba, Lokeshwor, and Dharma Dhatu Mandir on its premises.

It is assumed that in N.S.741 when King Jagarjyoti Malla was ruling over Nepalmandal, Devsingha Buddhacharya bought land from Hari in Badimangal Yugtole and made the Vihar.
In the names of the erectors, Dev Singh, Jaya Singha and Melu Singha’s names come first. And the very same Devsingha also established a statue of Dipankar Buddha in N.S.749 in the name of his son Devadas.
There is also the image of Pragyaparamita and Avalokiteshwora on the right and the left side of the main deity, Achhobhya Buddha.
The vihar is also famous for a certain event named Barhe Chukegu. It is a part of the traditional Buddhist Chudakarma ritual where the boys of Bajracharyas and Shakyas go through Acharya Abhisheka. The event is more likely considered as a Tantric in grace rite that qualifies any Bajarcharya to become a priest.
During Gunla, daily bhajans (singing hymns ) are regulated there.
However, the torans of the vihar is in bizarre conditions. There are no images of the replicated deity in it. Besides, the architecture of the vihar also seems devastated by the 2015 earthquake. Even though there are people living there.

As per the available scriptures, it was built in N.S. 750. And, fortunately, it is still in good condition, able to perform daily worshipping rituals and participate in Panchadan and Samyak Dan like holy events.
Beside Dipankar Buddha, there stands a statue of Mahankal, Manjushree, Ganesh and Shiva-Parvati, in this Mahavihar tagging the Red Tara. Some folk legends mention that Tara used to speak and was kept inside the bar while she was trying to leave the place.
That is why many Tibetans and people from the Himalayan regions often pay a visit to this place.

The Mahavihar, however, is also come to know as the home of Kumari of Bhaktapur. Each year, during Dashain, the living goddess Kumari resides here for 15 days.
Although, there is not much movement in the area, when you cross upon that road, a fragrance of incense steal away your attention. There is peace in the air.
While analyzing the spiritual values of that Mahavihar, one cannot just ignore the architectural form. The combination of the temple and local residents seems quite distinct yet attractive. The struts are as beautiful as the other wooden pieces of Bhaktapur. They are well carved and presented.

Likewise, there are Dharmadhatu Chaitya, Bajradhatu Chaitya, Khamba Chaitya, Gaju Chaitya, a hymning place (Sattal) with some fascinating paintings and a stone conduit on its premises. It’s a place worth visiting although the presence of local residents make you feel quite awkward, at first.

There is a beautiful courtyard inside the building where one can find small chaityas and stupa along with exquisite wood’s working and the image of Padmapani Lokeshwora, the central deity of the Bahi.
The vihar is placed in the highland, that’s why it is called thatu Bahi.
The vihar, as mentioned in the inscriptions and scriptures ascertains that it is way older than other vihars. The presence of two Chaityas and a gate with Panchabuddha summarises that it was made in the Lichhavi era.
There is even some chatter saying Na: Pukhu was later made on the land of Thathu Bahi.
It is said that the vihar was also renovated by King Jitamitra Malla and Ugra Malla after Jaya Ratna Bajracharya, who was a member of Chatur Varna Mahavihar.

Being located in Chochhen tole of Bhaktapur made it geographically the temple situated in the upper part of the Bhaktapur Nagara. It is said that Chochhen originally came up after the term Choye Chongu Chhen which means the house of the upper part.
Chuma Ganesh temple, on the other hand also has its own legendary story. Even the origin of its name has a story. It is said that the rats of that area beyond their nature scared the cats. And when someone tries to investigate the matter, they found out the image of Lord Ganesh.
Chuma Ganesha
Legends say that the name Chuma is derived from the term Chu and Ma which respectively means the rat and line. Thus, assuming Lord Ganesha worshipped by the large line of mice, the name of the temple began to be called Chuma Ganesha.
However, there is one more story that is slightly different from the aforementioned yet the core story of being rats powerful is the same. As per the story, when the king saw a fight between cat and rat and saw cat losing into the rat. He got amazed and follow the rat. There he found the Chuma Ganesh.
After being blessed by him, he was also told that there is Bhadrakali in the south of the area. And he should go there and worship her. The king as ordered went there and worship her. Being pleased by the king, she then gave him instruction to build a nagara in between these two areas; Chuma Ganesha and Bhadrakali temple.
Next, the king establishes the Bhaktapur Nagar along with the first Ganesh temple, Astamatrikas and Astabhairavas.
Besides, the architecture of the temple is likewise quite unique. Although it is a pagoda-style temple, its false tire has multiple layers like design which indeed is unique and satisfactory for the eyes.

Unlike other dyo chhen (god’s house), which looks more like a residence but this dyo chhen owns some features matching the temple. Equivalently, it’s rare to find double torans even in temples too. Besides a pinnacle (Gajur) and beautiful carvings over struts, windows and doors made it more of a diversion to the orbs.

About the age of the dyo chhen, there is no exact record regarding its erection yet there are some guesses which tells us that it might have been built when the Salan Ganesh temple was built. It somehow makes sense too. Considering, the dyo chhen is of Salan Ganesh temple, it could have been built during the same time period.

Moreover, the famous architect Mr Wolfgang Korn also remarks that it may be incorrect to describe buildings of this type as temples because they are called even on Newari Dyochhens, which means god’s house. However, only the replica of god is quartered over there.
Well, it’s quite easy to find this architecture foregoing the parade of local residences. On the northern alley of Salan Ganesh puku, the last building to the very west is the dyo chhen of Salan Ganesh Temple.

That building was said to be used by the priest who came to Bhaktapur, especially for the Biska Jatra. Also, the building was said to be the house of the essential elements of the biska jatra festival. 
There are numerous stories related to this particular building. It is said that there used to be a puja each year during Biska jatra in the Taumadhi square. That puja was specially held for the salvation of those spirits who had an unfortunate death. And the sages were said to make the big bread (roti or mari) in this particular place, thus it started to be called Aesamari Sattal.

It lies right behind the Shiddhapokhari of Bhaktapur, on the southern arena. All you need to do is cross the road toward the south of Shiddhapokhari. Make the traditional pati to your right( which has a small outdoor shop) and keep going. Within a few steps, you would be standing on the northeast corner of the Bhajupokhari.
People used to play football in the pond, lightly a few years back because there was no water in this pond. It was totally dried up and was only limited in the name of the history of Bhaktapur. Even, in the history of Bhaktapur, there is no accurate information about this pond.
Regarding Culture Activist, Om Dhaubhadel, Bhajupokhari was built by a general commander of King Jitamitra Malla, Bhagiram Pradhananga (Bhaju Kasaju/ Bhaju Kasa). By whom’s name, the pond is named Bhajuya Pukhu which means the pond of Bhaju. Later, it started to be called Bhajupukhu and then Bhajyapukhu. However, people also prefer to call it Bhajupokhari which all means the pond named by Bhaju.
Since there is no exact information regarding the erection period of the pond, considering the life ventures of Bhaju Kasa, it is guessed that it probably was built during N.S. 811/812. However, it is no sure date of its erection.
For the reconstruction of the pond, some pre-research and excavation work was also held in that area by the team of Historian and Culture Activist Dr Purushottam Lochan Shrestha. Surprisingly, some facts regarding the preceding temple and its antiquity have been unveiled. 
As per the study, there used to be a shikhara styled temple with an image of Jaleshwor. The temple is said to be built in the middle of the pond just like in the Ranipokhari of Kathmandu.
Likewise, it is assumed that the Bhajupokhari of Bhaktapur was made to replicate the Ranipokhari of Kathmandu. More or less, it is also believed that an earthquake ruined the pond along with its history, making it still a mystery."

Well, the inscriptions found here state that this Vihar is way older. As per the inscription, it was once renovated in N.S. 808. Likewise, the two golden images of Dipankar Buddha (one small and another big) was installed there in N.S. 684 (B.S.1621) and N.S. 689 (B.S. 1626).
Do you know that those images of Dipankar Buddha are roamed around in Thimi, Nagadesh and Bode on the day of Panchadan? That event is called Dipankar Jatra.
Besides, there is a  chaitya in this Mahavihar that is made anciently, recalling the lichhavi style of architecture. It apparently is the best thing to observe over there. However, there is one more statue of Bauddha Guru Padmasambhava which make this Vihar even more attractive.

Shree 3 Vishnu Bir Mai temple
Whatever the reason might be behind this naming but one thing is clear that this temple has a lot of significance. This temple is also called the temple of Vaishnavi, the shakti of Lord Vishnu.
Deities of Vishnu Bir Mai temple
During the Biska Jatra, the palanquin of this temple (the khat of Vishnu Bir) leads to the other five Ganesha’s palanquins. With that, there held a solo jatra of its called Vishnu Vir Khat Jatra at the end of the Baishak where its palanquin is roamed around the entire thimi. (Here, thimi is referring as the main thimi area)
The legends say that this temple was faced west and had 12 corners in the past. Meanwhile, today it is faced towards the east and is made in Gumbaj style. The temple houses unshaped images of God and Goddesses. In front of which, one can encounter a statue of Garuda, doing Namaste (adjoining hands position) and a hanging Pataah.

Besides the cultural values, this place seems important for religious purposes. Each year during Biska jatra the statues of Balkumari are put over there, who is the main deity of Sindoor jatra. Also, the courtyard which has the Taleju temple is remarkably attractive although the section is still under construction.

The mighty pond is said to be 40 years older than the Ranipokhari of Kathmandu. That’s why the Ranipokhari of Kathmandu used to be called “Nhu Pukhu “ which means the New pond. However, this Ranipokhari of Bhaktapur is not as big as Kathmandu’s.
Ranipokhari of Bhaktapur
As per the historian Dr Purushottam Lochan Shrestha, the Ranipokhari of Bhaktapur was ordered to be built by King Jagat Jyoti Malla, one of the greatest kings of Bhaktapur. It is assumed that he ordered the building of the pond in remembrance of his wife, Queen Rajlaxmi.
The found inscriptions state that it was built in 1687B.S.(1630 A.D, 750N.S.) within a timeframe of 5 months only. Later, it was renovated by King Jitmitra Malla in 1735. During the renovation, several statues of gods and goddesses were believed to be installed there. However, there are no signs of those artefacts in the current Ranipokhari.
Ranipokhari of Bhaktapur PC: bhaktapur.com/Prasant Prajapati
Unfolding history somehow reveals the facts that the pond was severally destroyed during the invasions of Kantipur and Lalitpur in Bhaktapur. Also, the artefacts appeared to be stolen during that time.  
It is said that there used to be a snake statue in the middle of the pond. As per some folklore, there stood the head of the “BasukiNaag” in this pond. Likewise, the body and the tails in the Shiddhapokhari and Na pukhu respectively. 
(These three ponds Ranipokhari, Shiddhapokhari and Na: Pukhu (Guhyepokhari) are considered sisters ponds.)
Besides the historical importance, it has another reason to be an important place to the Bhaktapurians. The Prajapati, Awal, Jochhen, Maharjan, Bhujitu, Rajlawat people of Bhaktapur do their digu puja at the premises of Ranipokhari. Moreover, they certainly perform the Ihi as well as the Bartabanda ceremony over there.
Ranipokhari of Bhaktapur PC: bhaktapur.com/Prasant Prajapati
On the southern part of Ranipokhari, there is a “Sattal” which had great use in the past. It is said that when Bhaktapur used to welcome Harishiddhi Naach and Naradevi Naach that used to be held once in 12 years, the dancers, as well as their team, used to rest in that Sattal before entering the Bhaktapur Nagar.
Sattal at Ranipokhari of Bhaktapur PC: Bhaktapur.com/ Praz Santt
Similarly, during Biska Jatra, a khadga used to come from Hanuman Dhoka Durbar which was also used to first settle down at the same sattal before entering Bhaktapur.
Ranipokhari now is open to the public as well.
(It was actually closed for the public since 2040 B.S. The land was used for army training and was under the control of the current Sainik Awasiya Vidhyalaya.)"

Perhaps, because the Siddhi Ganesha is assumed as the eldest son of Balkumari, he used to possess such priority. But unfortunately, today this series of acts are not performed. Moreover, some people assumed Siddhi Ganesha as Kumar too.
The temple of Siddhi Ganesh is located inside a courtyard and guess what, the entrance of the temple is no other than its dyo chhen. After entering the Dyo Chhen, you need to walk toward the north. You could encounter a pond, minor temples, people playing cards on nearby pati, while you walk toward the temple.

The siddhi kali temple premises
This two-storeyed temple is made in Pagoda style which showcases 17th-century architecture.  But the legends say that this Shaktipitha emerged from the fall of the right eye of Sati Devi. If you have heard or read about Swasthani Barta Katha, then it will be easier for you to understand this matter.
The temple of Siddhi Kali
As per the story, when Sati Devi died after jumping into the Yagya Kunda of her father’s (Dakshya Prajapati) Yagya, her immortal body was carried around by Lord Shiva (her husband). Because the body was carried by Lord Shiva himself, it did not dare to perish. However, because of that, Lord shiva started to live in grief, not caring about the universe. The only thing that he cared about was her body thus he continued to carry her and roam around the globe.
Seeing this despair of Lord Shiva, Lord Vishnu appeared as a fly and make the body of Sati perishable. Which after her body start to fall apart one by one. In that process, wherever the body part of Sati fell, a Shaktipitha emerged in that place. Thus, Shiddhikali appears to be the place where Sati’s right eye fell.

Moreover, the gold-gilded copper roof of this temple elegantly manages to hold this huge number of Pataa, falling from the top of the roof. Well, it seems that those Pataas are hung during festivals only.

However, this little complex is an important place from the point of view of history, culture, architecture and religion. As per the local anecdotes, the Taleju was first placed and worshipped over here. Later, it was transferred to the current Bhaktapur Durbar Square. Besides, this place is assumed one of the holiest places in Bhaktapur. No meat or sacrifice was ever allowed over here.
Also, during Dashain or the Mohni festival, there is a tradition of displaying a water clock in this Wane Layaku. Wane layaku, on the other hand literally means the eastern palace area.

Tadhuchhen Bahal was ordered to erect by King Raya Malla. An inscription like-board in the Vihar clearly states that it was built in N.S. 611 (1492 A.D). It also states that the Kings: Ram Malla, Raya Malla, Ari Malla, and Avaya Malla collaboratively invited Jibchandra Bajracharya and ceremoniously made him the main Gubaju of the Bahal. 
This vihar is also called Surat Shree Chaturvarna Mahavihar. It is said that the pioneer priest of the Vihar, who was Jibchandra Bajracharya, was also the son of the famous Tantrik Gubaju of that era, Surat Bajracharya. Considering a tribute to him, the initial name of the Vihar was named Surat Shree Chaturvarna Mahavihar. 
Also, about calling the place the Kumari House, it’s not like the kumari of Bhaktapur resides over there. But yes, it is said that the initial kumari of Nepal was established over there. Additionally, King Ranajit Malla also had set some rules regarding Kumari in the place as well.
Perhaps, that’s why it is also called Kumari house. Nowadays, only during Dashain (Mohni), for a week, the former Kumari is brought up here to fulfill some holy rituals.
Things to notice on Tadhuchhen Bahal
The Tadhuchhen Bahal is an attractive component in itself though there are many other things that surpass your imagination. Being in this centuries-old monastery, you might get wonder, conceiving what exactly is this place.  It looks like a blend of Buddhism and Hinduism.
The courtyard of this Bahal is surrounded by a pha-cha (a walkway on four sides) and the enclosed quadrangle is paved with brick tiles (chikanapa). There is a twayamapau i.e. a toran (a semi-circular decorative panel that normally is made either of wood or metal) hung above the main entrance gate of the bahal and above the sanctum as well.
The courtyard of Tadhuchhen bahal
PC: bhaktapur.com/Praz santt
Basically, it is decorated symbolizing the three jewels or the five Buddhas of the deity inside the shrine. So, glancing at them not only made you realize the great artistic views but also the religious aspects of creating them.
Erecting various protective deities is another feature of the Bahās and the Bahis. That’s why you could see the wooden sculptures of Ganga-Jamuna right after the entrance on your right and left in the Bahal. Also, there are statues of Bhairava and Ganesh on the struts to protect the Bahal from all bad happenings.
It is said that the image of Mahānkālto overcomes all dangers and a Chetrapāl protected the shrine.  You would also encounter Stupas and a stone Mandal in the courtyard. There is a belief that the center of this Mandal has a figure of Manjughosh, a form of Manjushree. 
Close to the Dharmadhatumandal (the stone Mandal) of a courtyard, there is a base for sacrifice place called Jogisāla in Newāri. It is used for Homa or fire sacrifice rituals. Plus, there is a statue of panchadhyani buddha with its shakti. Besides all these spiritual monuments, you could somehow, also encounter quite impressive things over there.
Yes, while you are there, don’t avoid glancing at the struts of the eastern part of the shrine. There are some wooden portraitures that portray the punishment of limbo which are returned according to their karma. It is a fact that wherever the temple of Lokeshwor exists these kinds of portraitures also exist.
The image shows two persons with huge stomachs. As per the locals, those big men could eat only one grain at a time. It was their punishment. So, they always starve to the death.

There are souvenir shops attached to the building.
Also, the famous Bara pasa: of Bhaktapur, covers some space of the bahal. It serves way more gratifying bara than you could ever have in your life. Both vegetarians and non-vegetarians could enjoy their kind of taste over there.

1.12 km","Wakupati Narayan Temple is a two-story pagoda temple dedicated to Lord Vishnu, enclosed within a stone-paved courtyard. It is located at Suryamadhi, Bhaktapur. A few minutes of walk from Chyamasingha towards the west leads you to this temple.
This temple is also called Wakupati Changu Narayan temple. People who couldn’t go to Changunarayan for prayer choose to go to Wakupati Narayan temple. It is like a substitution of the Changu Narayan temple.
Wakupati Narayan temple and premises
About the erection of this temple, it is said that the temple was built in 1667. However, there is one interesting story regarding the emergence of the Wakupati Narayan, the deity. As per the story, one devotee of Narayan who daily went to Changu Narayan had to stop going there because of the harvesting works.
He was too busy to visit the temple thus he remembers the Narayan, pray spiritually and go to work. One evening when he was returning back home with the sack of paddy, he found the image of Lord Vishnu in his sack. Since it was found within the sack of paddy, it was named Wakupati Narayan.
Here, Wakupati Narayan simply means the seen Vishnu while carrying the sack of paddy.
The temple by date seems more archaic than the Nyatapola temple and is in very good shape today. Despite some damage to neighbouring buildings, the ornate, golden temple survived the 2015 quake outlasting various distinct quakes.
Well, while you visit this temple, you would surely note the entourage of five Garudas supported on pillars on the backs of turtles. This is the only place where one would see five Garudas standing back to back in a row. However, the nearest one seems like a devotee rather than the Garuda as in the Dattatraya temple. You can clearly recognize the human face in it. But there are wings too to call him human as well.

Along with such mysterious creatures, there is an ancient stone tap inside the courtyard. Also, the stone scriptures of God and Goddesses. There is a statue of Lord Ganesha on the right side of the temple. Similarly, there is the image of Dasavatar of Lord Vishnu right behind the temple. You can have a guess recognising each of them while existing from that narrow space of the temple.
Nearby, there is a stone image of Goddess Saraswoti. There is even a temple of Chinna Masta, one among the Das Mahavidhyas on the southern arena of the main shrine.

On the premise of Wakupati Narayan temple
A huge mass of people visits the temple at Ekadashi. Although, people stay up during the Nitya Puja as well. Each day, in the morn and on the eve, the Pujari of the temple performs daily worship. And to witness that, the nearby people especially the senior citizens gather over there. 
Just within a while, you could see the gang of these older people on the premises of this temple who tend to laugh and gossiping in the patis (resthouse) of Suryamadhi, a minute before. They reach over there in such a perfect time as if it’s their daily routine to be there.
And of course, perceiving those glimpse of old people who shares a sort of stories with each other, including strangers like us really brings a smile to your face. Thus, It would be great if you could reach there in the evening, around 6 pm.
Also, there is a belief among the local denizens that if people sit in the courtyard while visiting the temple, the back pain is cured. It is like the blessing of God. So the people of Bhaktapur, still sit there at least once while visiting the temple, even if they are in a super hurry.
Wait, there is more to explore on the premises of this temple. Among several patis and minor temples from the premises, the pati from the end of the east corner consists of more exaggerating wooden artworks. It looks like leaving unavoidable crafting is a sign of the then Nepalese architecture.

Nearby the wood carving museum
Just accessing through the main door and reaching the inner yard would leave you with a big wonderment. But yes, before reaching there, you need to show your yellow-colored ticket to the guards of the museum.
If you already have visited the National Art Museum of Bhaktapur Durbar  Square or the Brass and Bronze Museum, then you don’t need to buy another one here. The same ticket works for you.
The ground floor of the wood carving museum
The rich wood carvings start to appear as soon as you step into the wood carving museum. The windows of the following floors, the struts, and the wooden pillars, make us realize that yes, we are in the woodcarving museum.
In the straight corner, there is a mask of Jayamal often called Jaya or Jai. He was a far-famed wrestler of the Malla era.
In front of it, there is a stairway that leads you to the very top and the third floor of the building.
*On the museum’s first floor, there is a room filled with wall paintings. But nevertheless, you might not call it actually a wall painting because the paintings are painted on a wooden platform that is attached to the room’s walls.
There are paintings depicting the Ramayana and Krishna Leela stories. On the beam, there are paintings of Nava Durgas (Astamatrika), Lord Vishnu’s Dasa Avatar. The room is literally filled with paintings, as there are paintings even on the ceilings.
Now, coming back to the third floor, you will find some of the most exquisite pieces of wooden art over there.
The museum is like a paradise for art admirers and practitioners. There are several statues made in the woods which consist of the statue of Bhairava, Vishnu, Buddha, Nitya Devi, Tara, Bhrikuti, Ganesha, Shiva, and many others.
The most satisfying part of being in the museum is that you can take pictures of these centuries-old crafts.
With the statues, there are torans, wooden pillars, and even boxes (safes) of different eras.
Besides these things, there is one unique thing that indeed is quite different from the ancient newa culture. A tiny window made out of brick, not the woods.
There might be some sort of story behind outputting such a window. Yet, there is one more thing that not only surprises you but also startled you.
After entering the third floor of the museum, you will find a small room on your left-hand side. It mentions that there is a statue of Bhairava with shakti (shakti means his consort) and some wall paintings.
Even after keeping that thing in your mind before entering over there, you would probably get startled. So, keep calm and enjoy what’s inside there.
Some historical facts related to the wood carving museum
The building of the current wood carving museum, which initially came into existence during the reign of King Yakshya Malla with the most epigraphic temple of Bhaktapur, The Dattatreya Temple.
After the blessing of King Yakshya Malla, it was rebuilt in 1763. And again renovated by German experts as the wedding gift to the then King Birendra in 1979.
The peacock window, being the most alluring woodcraft from the 15th century, even today made us come for it. You have to leave the museum to go look for the window because the window is placed on the eastern side of the building. A narrow street facing south (next to the museum) leads to this masterpiece.
Nearby the wood carving museum
The museum, of course, with the dark rooms and brazen woodcraft, showcases the then wood carvings. Nearby, there are some mini souvenir shops with miniature wooden peacock windows. And the brass and bronze museum to share the ticket, for instance.
Besides, there are different cafes and restaurants along with a small old shop, on the left corner of the Dattatraya temple.
However, the earthquake of 2015 made the museum quite terrible. But, it’s worthy enough to widen your eyes for the classics."

Sundhara; the golden conduit of Bhaktapur Durbar Square
About the making of Sundhara
More about the Sundhara
Well, Sundhara is one archaic conduit of Bhaktapur that lies within the Bhaktapur Durbar Square. It aesthetically is a very famous Hiti. Here, Hiti is a term, meaning the taps in the local language. Yes, this conduit that lies beneath the ground level is most commonly known as the Nagpokhari of the Durbar square.
Sundhara of Bhaktapur Durbar Square PC: Sameer Shakya
The conduit and its surroundings are all crafted and decorated through the images of serpents. Things might be the probable reason behind calling this golden conduit as Naag Pokhari. But in the studies, this conduit along with the pond was called Sundhara, which literally means the golden conduit.
You might also find people calling it Luhiti, which also means the golden conduit exactly in Nepal Bhasa ( most commonly known as the newari language).
Sundhara, on the other hand, is a symbol of unique aesthetic grace which is as its name is golden. It has one of the most extricating carvings on the mouth of the spout. The head of a non-castrated he-goat and the figures of different animals and Gods posing in that court really make you say, awe-inspiring.
Furthermore, in front of Sundhara, there is a diminutive pond, in the middle of which an image of gold-plated Naag with a wooden pillar does stand. Perhaps, that’s why people also call this arena Naag Pokhari rather than Sundhara.
Well, around the Sundhara and the pond, you can examine the brick thoroughfare with the stonewall enclosed by the amounts of the serpent including numerous figures of Gods and Goddesses.
Thus, it is unique.
About the making of Sundhara
Bhaktapur and its monuments, never stay emptied without an ambiguous and fascinating story. So, the same goes for this Sundhara.
King Jitmitra Malla, who seems to have contributed a lot to making temples, courtyards, and the palace itself was also one of the most creative kings of Bhaktapur. It is said that one night the Goddess Taleju obliged herself before King Jitamitra Malla, in his dream while the construction of the Thanthu royal palace was on, to the east of Taleju temple.
Know more about the Malla kings of Bhaktapur.
She then instructed him to make preparation for fetching water from the Mahadev river of Nagarkot to carry out the periodic worship of Taleju in the palace.
Consequently, water was then collected from around the smaller streams originating from Mahadev mountain in big storage. It was then diverted into a pond for necessary treatment and finally brought to the golden spout inside the palace through the Royal Cannel (Raj Kulo).
(That pond might be called today’s Mahadev Pokhari, where every year, on the month of Poush/Magh, devotees come and take bath as well as worship at the nearby Mahadev temple.)
The initiated work of constructing Sundhara along with the pond was begun in 1678 (798 Nepal Sambat) and completed in 1683 (803Nepal Sambat).
There is an even more impressive story recounted about this Sundhara. As per the anecdote, on the inauguration day of this Sundhara and pond, religious worship was offered to the Taleju Goddess invoking Tantrik Shakti, and a pair of white ducks were left to flow through this spout.
Legend has it that these ducks easily passed through the mouth of Sundhara turning into a smaller size. They were seen swimming in the pond. This process of appearing and disappearing of these ducks was said to be observed till some generations of the Malla period.

More about the Sundhara
The earliest water source of this conduit was Mahadev Pokhari, Nagarkot which later was taken over by the modern piped system.
However, amid the disruption of Raj Kulo, Sundhara also lost its natural source of water, and today, the modern piped system has been enlarged with the existing infrastructure of Sundhara. Though the water supply is limited and the water streams, for a few hours in the morning and evening for religious worship which also seems not regular.
The water Sundhara was used for the worship of the Thanthu palace. Also, the king and queen used to take bath in this conduit before leaving to have a rest near the Khopi (resting room).
The water of this conduit is still used to worship the Goddess Taleju. However, sometimes, the irregularity of the water flow compels to use of the encaged pond water nearby for religious worship in the Taleju temple.

A narrow street leads the way to the temple. The temple is particularly special because of the image of Lord Ganesh. But, it is not a sculpture. The image is rooted in a natural stone that has a symbolic form of Ganesha or the elephant-headed image.
Nowadays, it became more indistinguishable because of the red tika, covered all over it.
The Salan Ganesh is also sub-titled as the Adhi Ganesh among the asta Ganesh. During the procession process in Gai jatra, this temple is revolved by a bunch of people. Thus, because of that, it was called Salan Ganesha.
However, until today, the exact erection date of the temple has not been defined. Yet, some guesses call it the temple developed in the 13th century. Sumerialy, the date 1654 also arouses as its erected date.

Furthermore, it is presumed that the pond might have been in existence since the 16 or 17th centuries. From then till today, this pond remains in its initial structure. Along with the length and width of 300 and 150 ft respectively.
Nearby, in the north direction of the pond, there is an Agam Chhen of the respective temple. The architecture is best known for its eccentric display of woodcarvings. All the torans, windows, doors, as well as struts, are shaped in beautiful patterns.

Location wise, the Laxmi Narayan temple lies on the premises of Dattatreya Square. That, in the northern arena of the square.
Though this temple was erected in the 18th century, it still bears to stand in between us.
Architecturally, it is made off of multiple roofs. Which is more likely the traditional roofing style of Nepal. Although it is made in a traditional format, it still has some uniqueness. More than any other temple which seems similar to traditional architecture.
Moreover, on the other hand, this tiny heritage site is also a fine example of wood adeptness. One can observe the very well wood carvings in its entrances and torans.
Plus, there is a pair of lions too, in front of its entrance. That generally symbolizes the temple of Devi and the attending vehicles of Mahalaxmi.

Furthermore, the Laxminarayan temple is blessed with the pristine image of Laxmiarayan. But that doesn’t mean there are two statues of the deities i.e Laxmi and Narayan.

No one accurately knows about them. In those dusting and busts of the city, the erection of the Bhimsen temple also got faded.
Somehow, the archaeologists presume, it was erected in 1605 CE. While some other sources dated it back to the 18th century.
This two-floored rectangular pagoda, the temple of Lord Bhimsen is located right in front of the Dattatreya Temple within the premises of Dattatrya square. Plus, it was renovated lately in the year 2018. However, it is standing in its initial structure until now. As the name of the temple assumes, it is the temple of lord Bhimsen.
The Bhimsen temple is often called Bhisindyo or Bhindyo by the local people.
This Bhimsen temple is extraordinarily large in length unlike any other temple in Bhaktapur. Plus, there are 7 pinnacles crowning in the tiny and pretended tier of the temple.
The windows, doors, and struts alike are filled with beautiful carvings. For instance, the temple is not only blessed with the Bhimsen but also with the statue of Draupati. Here, Draupati is one of the main characters of Mahabharata, who was also the wife of Panch Pandava.
Adding more, the ground floor of its looks like a resting place. Since it is open to everyone and has nothing except a big space. Within the same series, there is a doorway guarded by two stone images. Ultimately, that portal guides to the main temple of Bhimsen.
About the Lord Bhimsen
Bhimsen is a god with a red face, angry eyes, and a thick dark moustache. He is worshipped as the god of trade and commerce. Perhaps, because of that, every household has had its portrait, especially in the shops. They believe that the praying of Lord Bhimsen would bring good fortune and success in business.

Usually, the local people come and worship in the temple but the traders often come on Saturday to do worship. It seems Saturday is one special day to worship Bhimsen. Besides that, the bhimsen is worshipped especially on Holi Purnima and Yomari Purnima.
Bhimsen pokhari of Bhaktapur
With the temple, a conduit is attached, right to its back. That is a conduit but for some unknown reason, it is also called a pond. That’s why that conduit along with the assumed pond is called Bhimsen pokhari.
Meanwhile, some shreds of evidence show up as the conduit made in the lichhavi period. The northern, as well as the southern steps, still have some sort of carving evidence.  That mentioned the name of some, of the then rulers of Bhaktapur like Raya Malla, Ram Malla, Rana Malla, and Bhim Malla. It was placed during its renovation.
With that, different classic statues like the statue of Narayan with four hands, Chandra, Surya, Ganesh, and some others are also established over there. Similarly, as the attraction, the conduit itself beholds the antique beauty.

About the emergence of Til Madhav Narayan
The temple of Til Madhav Narayan is one of the most important temples of Nepal, as it is one of Nepal’s oldest temples, dating back to 238 N.S. (1118 A.D). Even yet, it manages to stand straight in a good position between us.

Til Madhav Narayan
Til Madhav Narayan is one of Lord Vishnu’s incarnations. Even if no one could enter the temple, the statue of Garuda, conch and wheel confirmed the presence of the deity. There is also Lord Natyeshwor, who is supposed to have been established there to protect Til Madhav Narayan.
According to the temple priest, the depiction of Til Madhav Narayan differs greatly from other renderings of Narayan. He explained that this statue only has three hands. Another restriction is that no worshipers are permitted to visit the shrine or even see the Lord Narayan statue.
And, yes, photography is not permitted inside the temple.
The temple is open from 4 a.m. to 8 p.m. During this period, the priest performs Nitya puja at around 5:30 a.m. and Sandhya Aarati at 5 p.m.
Furthermore, Til Madhav Narayan’s idol is also worshipped as Janai Dharan Narayan, who is said to be untouchable by the girls.
Til Madhav Narayan, the deity who blesses the devotees with children
A courtyard, in addition to the temple, is considered sacred by Bhaktapurians. Because Ihi, one of the most essential rituals of every newa girl, was sometimes performed there.
In addition, on important occasions, devotees from faraway regions such as Pharping and Panauti come here in the hope that the Lord may grant their wishes. According to the temple priest, if anybody obtains the clarified butter (Ghee) of the naval of the Til Madhav Narayan on the fourth day of the Magh, his/her request is granted.
It is a local belief.
On the day of Maghe Sankranti, the statue of Til Madhav Narayan is immersed in clarified butter and presented to worshippers after four days. It is often held that God fills the laps of individuals with children who are experiencing difficulties with childlessness.
As a result, it is also revered as the deity that bestows offspring on followers.
About the emergence of Til Madhav Narayan
According to legend, even after selling tons of sesame seeds, one trader noticed that he had many more sesame seeds than he should have, and it wasn’t even close to being finished. There he discovered the image of Til Madhav Narayan.
Since then, devotees have offered Sesame seeds (Til) to the deity on the day of Maghe Sankranti every year. In addition, the god is worshipped on the days of Janai Purnima and the Madhav Narayan Festival in Bhaktapur."

Balkumari temple and the biska jatra
How to get there?
The Balkumari temple has a brick-paved rectangular courtyard. Also, the minor and major deities within it like the Digu Bhairava temple.
The temple itself is of a three-falsehood which has amusingly impressive hanging Pataas. It also has a column in front of it, which has a beautiful representation of a peacock. There were more peacocks in its tier corners. But they all were stolen, leaving one among them.

That’s why it was once sealed with strong iron bars including the Balkumari temple. But now, the iron bars have been removed and the temple is in its initial face.

The legends about the Balkumari temple
The temple has a long story, nearly dating back to the 17th century. Of course, cause the temple was established at that time. The legends say that a merchant of Madhyapur usually went to Lubu for trading purposes along with his group. But he somehow fell in love with the princess of the Lubu and vice versa.
Soon, the princess also got pregnant. For that reason, she asked the merchant to take her away with him to the thimi. The merchant happily accepted her proposal but at the same time, he put a condition too.
The condition was that if she wanted to come to thimi with him, she must bring the balkumari with her.
That the princess also happily accepted and brought the deity to the thimi. From that time, the deity was permanently shifted to thimi.
Plus, there is a womb-like structure right above the idol of the deity. That, in some way, justifies the story of shifting the deity by the pregnant woman.

BALKUMARI TEMPLE
PC: KTM guide
The Balkumari temple became a course of titling and tattling when it came to the Biska Jatra. Yes, because this temple is foremost related to the vermilion festival, ordinarily known as Sindur Jatra. The jatra initially starts from this temple. But her chariot is not rounded to the whole city as other chariots do.
Her chariot is taken up to the temple of Prachanda Bhairva. Since it is believed that the ancient thimi was bordered that place in the north.
How to get there?
The temple is not a challenging place to reach instead it is truly quick to reach there. Half an hour of a taxi ride drops you at the entrance of the temple from Baagbazaar. Alternatively, if you choose to ride a local bus, then it might take around 45 minutes of time to reach thimi.
The Naya thimi, the bus conductor as well as the locals call the place Naya Thimi. From where you have to walk for exactly 5 minutes. There, on your left-hand side, on your second turn, you would find the temple."

Some extra notes
King Bhupatindra Malla erected it in 1698 A.D. Also, picturesque it as Malatichwok. But locals prefer to call it Simhadhwoka layaku rather than Malatichwok. Later, in 1960, the Government of Nepal and the Department of Archaeology set it up as the National Art Gallery.
The National Art Museum was inaugurated by Bishwesvar Prasad Koirala. He was Nepali Congress Supreme and the very first elected prime minister of Nepal.
Consequently, this museum is the best among the three museums of Bhaktapur. You can easily find this place, once you enter the Bhaktapur Durbar Square. The two stone images of lions pleasantly embrace you.

Along with that, another stone sculpture of Hanumanta-Bhairav and Nar-Shima also shows you the way toward the museum.

Statue of Narshima
Notwithstanding, this museum has a small acquisition. But, it has a good collection of manuscripts and chronicles, which date back to the 11th century. Similarly, it is the home of ancient Paubha Scroll paintings, tantric cloth paintings. Also, the artefacts of bronze, brass, stone, and wooden images.
This architecture is not in its fundamental shape after the devastating earthquake of 1934 A.D. Yet, was also harmed in the quake of 2015. But, it is protecting a lot of unique discoveries in it. That includes the stone varieties on its ground floor.
The ground floor of the National Art Museum
As you enter the National Art Museum, you would find a counter where you have to pay and take the tickets. Advantageously, you won’t need to buy tickets for another two museums of Bhaktapur ( wood carving museum and the brass and bronze museum), once you buy one over there.
The tour of the Museum starts with the masks of Nava Durga, the most prestigious deities of the Bhaktapur, and the statue of four-handed Ganesha. Along with that, you can notice some stone inscriptions on your right-hand side.
The next room separated by a door somehow offers you more than the old inscriptions and masks. You would encounter the four-faced shivaling and other reverse statues of Surya, Kubera, Vishnu, Ardhanareshwor, Tara, Laxmi Narayan, and many more.
With that, this floor displays the most erotic paintings of god and goddess, specially dedicated to the Bhairava and his shakti. The description regarding those paintings says that the bhairava over here is shown in an extensive system of yogic union with his shakti, Bhairavi.
Simply looking at these paintings, one can see them engaging in sexual posture but the philosophy of such posture is quite different from what one sees through eyes. Those postures depict the tangible expression of the metaphysical concept that salvation results from the yogic union of the male and female organs.
However, there is one more image consisting of Mahasambhara that portrays the Mahasambhara, one of the popular deities of the Vajrayana cult of Buddhism in his extensive system of Yogic union with his shakti, Bajrabarahi.
The first floor of the National Art Museum
The very first floor of the National Art Museum is filled with paintings of different eras. And, it has an all-embracing paintings collection of airbrushing Vasundhara, Ganesh Shakti, Mahisa Sambhara, Vajra Yogini, Asta Bhairava with their shakti, and Shiva. It also has the classic paintings of Krishna Leela and Madhukaitavabadha.
The images of various kings and princes after King Prithi Narayan Shah are also depicted over there. The very first thing that you would notice over there is those immense memories of the kings.
Furthermore, the stage has centuries-old written inscriptions which apparently make us wonder and think about the inventions of that era. On top of that, the handwriting is super good.

It sounds quite weird. But another devastating earthquake of April 2015 brought this temple in its real posture. Today, the temple is again in the same shape. Yes, it is in the shikhara style as it was originally built.
Moreover, the most valuable thing, that this temple consists of is the statue of the Harihar. It is a combining form of lord shiva and Vishnu. That people call Badri Narayan or Badrinath. That then turns out to be the name of this temple.

Aside from that, there is an intriguing story concerning the Chyasalin mandap’s construction, which explains why it was built between the Pashupatinath temple and the 55-window palace. There is a Hindu concept that one should not live in front of the glorious deity.
And living directly in front of the Pashupatinath shrine was bad for both the king and the kingdom. Thus, Chyasalin Mandap is reported to be built in between them to avoid the temple’s powerful aurora from directly striking the palace.
This venue once was also a popular choice for the poetry contest. According to published knowledge, King Bhupatindra Malla and his consort once held a poetry competition at this spot.
This pavilion was also used to welcome royal guests, observe festivals, and enjoy the breathtaking sunset views.
Unfortunately, it was destroyed by the catastrophic earthquake of 1934 A.D. and lost its original form. Later, in 1992 A.D., the German architects graciously reinstall this covering at its original speed. They used steel and the ruins of the old chyasalin mandap there.

The lanpadegal consists of three newari words. Lan, pa, and dega ( degal). That means road, obstruction, and temple respectively. Therefore, people know this temple as a temple bothering the road. According to this, lanpadegal became the name of this site.

However, that area, before the establishment of the temple was already popular for the Shaivism pilgrims. It was well known as Lalitmaheshwor. Regarding which there are inscriptions found in the temple.
But, it was definitely not triple-roofed, then. During the reign of King Vishwa Malla, the temple was gracefully restored in a one-storeyed temple.
After, King Jagatjyoti Malla decorated it with golden roofs.
Likewise, in N.S. 788, King Jagat Prakash Malla established his own image along with his minister Chandrashekhar in the temple while having a grand worshipping.
Later on, King Bhupatindra Malla modified it into a triple roofed temple at around N.S. 837-38 (1718 AD) and added the seven golden pinnacles in it. (Renovation of Bhairavanath temple, Bhaktapur Municipality)
The reconstruction took time after the engineering of the Nyatapola temple.

By worse luck, the devasting earthquake of 1934AD collapsed it.  And optimistically reassembled in the same structure. The ruinous earthquake of April 2015 again, made this temple renovated. It also destroyed the tiny way, passing through the betal temple. That ultimately leads toward the interior part of the Bhairavanath temple.
The anecdote about Bhairavanath
With a renovative history, this temple also owns an interesting anecdote, passed orally by our ancestors. According to this, the lord bhairava of Varanasi once visited Bhaktapur to see bisket jatra.
Bisket jatra is one of the biggest jatras of the newar people. During the festival, the lord Bhairava somehow was recognized by a priest and he just cast a decoy spell on him. 
As a quick reaction, he started to sink into the terra firma to go back to Varanasi. But the priest didn’t let him go. As if, he grabs the head of Bhairava in his hand and decollates him with his sword. That’s why people say that the head doesn’t match the body of Kasi Vishwanath. It is also believed that the head is still treasured in a box of this temple."

The Dattatraya temple is also considered one of the major as well as oldest temples of Bhaktapur.
King Yaksha Malla, who ruled over the entire Nepalmandal from 1428 A.D. to 1482 A.D. is supposed to be the erector of this temple. As per the book, Illustrated Biography of Lord Duttatreya And His 24 Mentors, this temple was built in Nepal Sambat 590 (1470 A.D.) and was only single-storeyed then.
However, it is mentioned that the temple was opened to the public onward 1486 A.D, only after the demise of King Yakshya Malla, of course, before the reconstruction made by King Raya Malla (the son of King Yakshya Malla). He made it more attractive by adding stories to it in Nepal Sambat 615 (1495 A.D).

Explaining its accessories. There are 5 Ganesha, 5 tiers, 5 plinths, 33 steps, 108 struts, and  360 battens used in the temple. Whereas, all these numbers have a significant role in tantrism. Besides, it dubiously shows the tantric influence of that time.
Nyatapola Temple
Which God is in Nytapola Temple?
Goddess Shiddhi Laxmi, the powerful tantric goddess, is inside Temple.
Who erected Nyatapola?
Whenever we talk about the Malla kings’ of Bhaktapur, the very first name that strikes our mind is King Bhupatindra Malla. Right? Perhaps, because of the statue of King Bhupatindra Malla that was pleasantly postured in front of the Golden Gate of the Durbar Square.
Despite that, we remember him as an ideal King of Bhaktapur. Of course, he contributed a lot to the art and architecture of this tiny burgh. There, Nyatapola comes among them. 
Statues and struts
Statues of Guardians
guardians-nyatapola
Whenever you pass through those stone steps of Nyatapola. Once in a time, a thought arises in mind, why these stone images are here, and what are they?
Symphonically, there are five plinths in Nyatapola, where each plinth has a pair of stone images.
It is said that they are the guardians of the Goddess Shiddhi Laxmi. From the bottom to the end of the plinth, there is a stone image of Wrestlers, Elephants, Lions, Griffins, and two Goddesses named Sighini and Baghini respectively.
They all are placed according to their strengths. The first two wrestlers named Jai and Pratap are said to be 10 times stronger than a normal man. Along with that, the elephants, who are considered as 10 times stronger species than those wrestlers are placed above them.
With such a ratio, the guardians are placed.
Statue of Shiddhi Laxmi
The foremost deity of the Nyatapola temple is the Goddess Shiddhi Laxmi. Since it is a powerful tantric deity. No ordinary people are allowed to enter this temple. So, no one knows how the deity looks besides the priests. But, we can imagine her in our thoughts.
The studies about Nyatapola say that the statue of Shiddhi Laxmi is 9 feet tall, carved in black stone. That statue has 9 heads but in three rows. The very first row has 5 heads and is called Chandi Bhadra kali. Similarly, the second row with three heads is called Pratysngira.
Last, but not least, the top acne is called Shiddhi Laxmi. This immense and bold statue had nine pairs of hands. Also, there are two figures of Mahakal Bhairav and Masan Bhairav on either side of the statue.
Drighu Ganesh
With those stone guardians, you may have noticed the four Ganesh temples in four corners of the Nyatapola. They are the temple of Drighu Ganesh. They were established over there for the protection of the temple. Two out of the four temple faces the south. And the rest of the two to the north.
Drighu Ganesh Temple
Although there are only four temples, there are actually five Ganesha whom people do worship. The very southwestern temple is also called the temple of Jor Ganesha, which means a pair of Ganesha. Counting those two Ganesha in one temple and another three of the remaining temples makes a total of five Ganesha.
The stone tap
Right behind the temple, a north-facing stone tap unknowingly adds beauty to this structure.  The first plinth of the temple holds this tap.
The struts
Just like the stone images, the strut images are also magnificent. Probably, they are the best show of woodcarving. The very first and the second floor’s struts have wooden images of Astamatrika. That means the images of Bramayani, Maheshwari, Kumari, Vaishnavi, Barahi, Indrayani, Mahakali, and Mahalaxmi.
Continuously, the struts of the third tier have an image of Lokeshwor. In the same way, the images of Mahalaxmi and Shiva-Shakti are carved in the fourth and fifth tier’s struts respectively. Therefore, this eye-glancing structure is also filled with the most artistic woodcarvings.

Some interesting facts about the Nyatapola temple
The temple is not associated with any Jatras or the Guthi. That sounds quite unusual cause almost all of the important temples are associated with the jatras as well as with the Guthis and Bhajans. Especially in Bhaktapur.
Because of its five stories, it is locally denominated as a Panch Tale Mandir. Where, those five stories indicate the earth, water, fire, air, and the sky from down to up respectively.
Similarly, Nyatapola the name itself means the five-stroyed, where Nyata means five, and Pola means the tiers in Newa bhasa. 
Also, this grand temple stands as the tallest Nepalese roofing-styled temple of Bhaktapur. As well as Nepal with a height of 33meters.
The whole structure of Nyatapola was raised within 214 days. During that era, meanwhile, there was no advanced construction equipment at all.
It is said that the wind bells hanged around the tiers of Nyatapola were in several 529. But placing them in the numbers 48, 80, 104, 128, and 168, from top to bottom respectively, outlasts a wind bell. That was then, considered as the unfortunate one wind bell. And, the fact is that till today no one knows about it, whether where it was placed. Or, what did happen to it?
Nyatapola, at present
Considering the minor damages of the newest quake, the Bhaktapur Municipality did consider renovating it. Along with the other historical sites. The renovation of Nyatapola was completed with half of its estimated budget.
Nonetheless, that became possible through the support of the residents of Bhaktapur. Therefore, the Nyatapola is now completely restored. In the year, 2020 A.D.

The palace was finally set during the reign of King Ranjit Malla in 1754 AD.  King Ranjit Malla, the son of King Bhupatindra Malla also contributed a lot to this palace. Unbearably, the tear downing earthquake of 1934 AD demolished the palace.

46.41 m","Vatsala Durga temple is the white elegance of Bhaktapur Durbar Square. It looks more like the Krishna Mandir of Patan but it’s not the one. It is the temple of Tantric Shakti, Durga that is established in the form of Sri Yantra.
You can see a Kalash as the representation of Vatsala Durga in the temple which was possibly possible to observe only after the quake of April 2015. Before that, the temple used to be locked and people be like totally unknown about what actually is inside this temple?
As we still wonder about the sanctum deity of the Nyatapola.
The goddess once was used to be worshipped from that locked door but today, devotees could enter there and satisfyingly worship her.
It has nine pinnacles altogether. The small ones hold the temples with images of goddesses on the first floor, for instance. Thus, terming this Vatsala Durga temple, the temple of the temples would not be inappropriate. Similarly, the pair of lions and elephants in front of the entrance particularly shows the elegance of the temple.
You can feel the intense carvings by yourself, once you touch them.
Also, there is a big barking bell in front of the temple. The anecdote says that dogs start to bark and whine when it rings. It was established there by King Bhupatindra Malla in 1721 A.D. while he renovated it.
History says King Jagat Prakash Malla started the construction of the temple in 1672 AD. But, it was completed by King jitamitra Malla in 1674 AD. King Jitmitra Malla was the son of King Jagat Prakash Malla. So, this temple holds the contributions of two Malla kings at the same time.
Actually, we can count them on three. There comes a little contribution of King Bhupatindra Malla, after all, in the beautification of the temple.

By fair means, even after the devastating earthquake of 2015, it is giving pose to the coming generation with the same ethnic speciality but in fresh wear."
