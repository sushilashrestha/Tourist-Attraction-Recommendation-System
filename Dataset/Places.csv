Just a 5-10 minute walk from the way to go to ranikot is a beautiful place called Chuchhe Dhunga. There are only some iron railings for now in the place surrounding a few big rocks. But from there, you can have an immensely beautiful view of the Kathmandu Valley.
The Kathmandu Valley is surrounded by green hill stations and beyond that, you can see a number of mountain ranges.
Thus, it is a perfect destination for anyone who wants to feel the cold breeze, hang out with friends, or take some time for himself/herself.
You can even arrange a day hike up to Chuchhe Dhunga or simply ride your bike up until you reach the Ranikot route. However, keep in mind that you must walk a little further and avoid mounting the steps.",Natural Landmark"Doleshwor Mahadeva, the head of the Kedarnath","Doleshwor, Suryabinayak

A pilgrimage to these three sacred spots is thought to wash away all of one’s sins and provide an opportunity to receive heavenly blessings from Lord Shiva.
Shree 1008 Jagat Guru Bheemashaankarling Shivacharya, the top priest of Kedarnath, officially designated Doleshwor Mahadev as the head of Kedarnath, one of the Char Dham Yatra, on August 22, 2009.
For the last 4,000 years, the general population was unaware of the connection between Kedarnath and Doleshwor.
Looking back at Doleshwor Mahadev’s history, it is claimed that after the Mahabharata of Kurushetra, the Pandav brothers headed for the Himalayas in seek of Lord Shiva’s pardon for the deaths of many people during the conflict.
But, because Lord Shiva was unwilling to forgive them, he disguised himself as a bull. Knowing about Lord Shiva’s disguise as the fleeing bull, the Pandavas captured the tail of the bull, at which point the head of the bull became split from the remainder of the body.
The remaining body is thought to be in Kedarnath, India’s Uttarakhand state and people have been looking for the head since then.
After a severe flood damaged the temple of Kedarnath in Uttarkhand in 2013, the regular prayers that had been stopped were carried out in Doleshwor Temple. The head priest of the Kedarnath Temple requested that regular prayers be held in the Doleshwar Mahadev Temple instead of the Kedarnath Temple.",MonumentMaha Manjushree Temple (Saraswatisthan or Lhasapakhe),"Bagishwori, Bhaktapur

Saraswotisthan
One among them is the temple of Goddess Saraswoti and another is of the Maha Manjushree. Because of this, people seem to have a little confusion regarding the different names of the same place.
Mahamanjushree temple
Besides, Saraswotisthan and Maha Manjushree temples, that place is also called Lashapake (Lhasapako), Ratnagiri, Mahamandapgiri, and sometimes Thakalmath danda. One can witness the beautiful religious harmony over there among the Buddhist and Hindu religions.
There is not much information about the establishment of the Saraswoti temple but there is an interesting story related to the Maha Manjushree temple.
Mahamanjushree Temple
According to the chronology of Nepal, when Mahamanjushree came to Kathmandu Valley to exalt self-enlightened Swayambhu in Tretayuga, he is said to have resided in Thakalmath danda (Maha Manjushree Danda).
And, after that, he went to outlet the water of Naagdaha (serpent’s living lake) by cutting the gorges of Guheswari, Chobhar, and Katuwal with his Chandrahas Sword.
He is claimed to have settled the Kathmandu Valley after cutting the gorges. In our history books, he is also credited with founding the city of Manjupattan and erecting the throne of a monarch named Dharmakar, indicating that he was already of prehistoric importance.
Accordingly, his activities like staying and meditating at some particular place relatively have to have phenomenal importance. That’s why this place has both religious and historical importance. Besides, it delivers a great view of the Kathmandu Valley, although it is quite quashed with smoke and dust.
Mahamanjushree danda
Since the place was reverenced as Maha Manjushree’s cave, several Buddhist sages and Siddhas are believed to have visited this place. One of them was the great Poet and Buddhist master ‘Milarepa’ from the 11 – 12th century. It is believed that he visited the place at the invitation of the king from Kathmandu valley.
This is one of the important power places for Buddhist practitioners with great positive vibrations.
-Nagarkot (Facebook Page)
Again, there is one more belief that every devotee, perhaps, believes in. It is said that in the cave of Maha Manjushree (very well known as the temple of Maha Manjushree), a sound of blowing wind comes and that wind is believed to be coming from Lhasa.
Lhasa, from where Maha Manjushree, himself is believed to have come from.

It is said that when local women make ‘raksi’, the local homemade liqueur, they come and worship at this temple, offering Ganesh some of the local brews.
Also, this Chonga Ganesh temple is counted among those three Ganesh temples of Bhaktapur which create a magical triangle that forms an outer ring of a Mandala. Symbolically, it protects Bhaktapur. The centre of this mandala is said to be either the Taleju Temple in Durbar Square or the Tripursundari Temple located near Sukhudhwakha.
This fact is depicted in the Shri Yantra Mandala, a Newar painting from the 19th century. The painting is still safe on the first floor of the National Art Museum of Bhaktapur Durbar Square.
However, as already mentioned, the Chonga Ganesh temple premises is now more famous for picnics. Each Saturday, the place gets filled with people since it has a good space in between the woods of Salla. Because of those trees of Salla, this place is also called Sallaghari.

It flows through the rural and urban areas of the Bhaktapur district before joining the Manohara River at Jadibuti in Kathmandu.

Locals, in their own language call this place khorhe. However, this place is quite similar to the Pashupatinath too, in terms of having a cremation expanse along with the sack of temples. 
There are significant places of Sitala Mai, Hanuman, Mata Bhagwati, Badrinath, draupati Bhimsen, and Astamatrika. Along with them, there is a huge Shivalinga installed outside the entrance. Some beautiful statues of Buddha, Ganesh, and Ram Sita are also established over there.

Hanumanghat, locally called ‘Khorhen’ by the locals is located at the confluence of two rivers, namely, Brahmayeni Khola River flowing from the north-east side and Tabyakhusi Khola River flowing from the south-east side. The river carries the name Hanumante only downstream of the confluence of these two rivers.

There is a belief with regards to the religious importance of Hanumanghat, Hanumanghat is considered to be located at Tribeni (confluence of three rivers) of Bira, Bhadra, and Tamasa. To them, Bira is Brahmayeni Khola River Bhadra is Tabyakhusi Khola River and the river Tamasa is coming out from the ground.

Besides all of these temples and statues, there is one beautiful statue of Budanilkantha. People worshipped it as Bhujasi Narayan. The statue is said to be transferred over there from one of the courtyards of 99 courtyards of Bhaktapur Durbar Square, after the earthquake of 1990.
Considering all these facets of Hanuman Ghat, it could easily be sanctioned as a religious pilgrim.  While, on the other hand, because it has a cremation area, many people avoid going there at night.
Ghats are said to be an abode of ghosts, evil spirits, fierce deities, and tantric. That’s why it sounds quite scarier too.
hanuman ghat
Ghat is a Nepalese word that means the cremation area. Also, one of the features of ghats is being situated near rivers or Triveni. This, Hanuman ghat is also blessed with Triveni. Triveni generally means the confluence of three rivers. Near Hanuman ghat, a river named Bira ( streamed from Jagati), along with another river named Bhadra (running from Maheshwari) collide with the third river named Tamasa.
It is also believed that the Tamasa river does not pass from elsewhere instead the origin of this river is said to be this pilgrimage, Hanuman ghat itself.
Hanuman ghat during monsoon
Well, there is an interesting story regarding its orientation. As per which, when Lord Ram along with Sita and Hanuman was returning from the after-battle at Lanka, he paused at this place. After some rest and bath, they sat on a stone near the river and started to have fruits.
Meanwhile, Hanuman was in a jittery situation, thinking about sharing foods from the same plate as his master’s. He, in any situation, could not let his master eat the same food touched by his Jhuto hands.
(Jhuto means impure in the Nepalese language. While you are eating, your hands are assumed Jhuto until you washed them. Thus, while eating you are not allowed to enter the Kitchen, temple and another restricted area in Nepal.) 
To resolve his inner dilemma, he founded a new origin of Ganga beneath his tail which we call the Tamasa river nowadays. With the pure water of Ganga, he used to wash his hands each time he took a bite from the plate.
You can imagine, that scene must be quite hilarious. Washing hands beneath the tail that each time when you have a bite. When Lord Ram noticed this interlude, he asked Hanuman that why is he acting this weird just like a typical monkey. 
Which after, Hanuman explained all his dilemmas and deeds. Seeing Hanuman’s this devotion, lord Ram then hugged him tightly. It is said that after that incident the place was started to call Hanuman ghat though.
astamatrika at Hanuman ghat
However, people still believe that one time in a day, Hanuman appears to bathe over there. And, during that time, the way toward this ghat seems vanished or clouded.
Well, that one was an interesting story associating with Ramayan. Moreover, there is one more darn which states that the statue of Balmikeshwor Mahadev of Khorhe was erected by the Balmiki himself. Balmiki is that person who is revered as the author of Ramayana.

Out of so many temples why Goraknath?
The actual Gorakhnath temple was Built by Prithvi Narayan Shah and was dedicated to Gorakhnath who was a famous Yogi who traveled widely across India. It is situated ten meters down the southern side of Gorkha Palace. 
Perhaps, because of some connections of King Prithivi Narayan Shah to this place, the concerned people are making Goraknath temple over here. They say that when King Prithvi Narayan Shah was having ease taking five villages, viz., Panauti, Banepa, Nala, Khadpu, and Sanga, he returned to Nuwakot via Changu.
During that journey, he is said to have stayed at Trishul Danda. During his stay, he found that this place is worth making a fort, allowing him to have an eye on the entire Kathmandu Valley. Thus, he made a fort there named Mulkot fort just like the Ranikot fort.
Since the story goes far as there are rumors it is said that he had planned to attack Kathmandu Valley from this fort. In the meantime, it is said that he worshipped Mahankal very ascetically. Hence, this might be one reason behind calling this place Mahankal Trishul Danda as well.
The Trishul danda means the hill station named by the Trident of Lord Shiva but it is more familiar to the locals as the Mahankal Trishul danda. There are more people who even perform their annual Kuldevata puja over there.
There are two natural Shiva Lingam, a tall Trishul, a temple of Shree Santoshi Mata, an idol of Shree Panchamukhi Hanuman, an Ashram of Trishul Baba, a view tower, a Peepal tree, and four-faced Shiva Lingam surrounded by a beautiful garden.

Even after the continuous initiatives of mara, Buddha did not resist leaving his meditation. In that meantime, Buddha called to the earth goddess to witness his enlightenment by touching the earth.

About the naming of the temple, there is one darn adopted by all. In Hindu pilgrim, Surya means the sun who is also worshipped as a god and it is widely believed that the first ray of the sun directly touches the feet of this image of Binayak or the Ganesh. That’s why this Ganesh shrine is named Suryabinayak which means the merger form of the sun and Ganesh.
It takes only half an hour to reach over there from Bhaktapur Durbar Square. If you are not fit to walk enough, then you could choose to ride your own vehicle which will take only 10 min. Isn’t it great?
However, You have to ascend some stairs by yourself to reach the premises of Suryabinyak temple. From the start of the ascending stairs, you could notice temples of different deities until the entrance of the temple premises. Well, the courtyard of this temple contains a pati too which gives a tremendous view of the Bhaktapur City.

Along with the pati, there are statues of Suryabinayak himself, Shivalinga, Malla kings and the mount of Lord Ganesha, Mushak (mouse) over the premises of Suryabinayak temple. There is also a water conduit to wash out before worshipping (Puja).
The physical evidence of the temple states that it was built in the early 17th century. That somehow points to the fact that it was built during the reign of King Bhupatindra Malla. Some rumours also state that it was built by King Vishnu Dev Barma while some say it is old enough to declare its age more than a thousand-year.

There is another interesting folk related to the creation of the forest including the arise of Suryabinayak himself. As per the priest of the temple, when Hanuman was hurrying up to transfer the hill full of medicinal herbs while he was unaware of one medicinal herb named Sanjibani Buti, a small piece of that hill was fall and thus turns down as the hill of Surya Binayak.
If you are well aware of the story of Ramayana, then you could probably be well aware of this incident as well. Coincidently, the hill of Suryabinayak is also full of medicinal herbs.

Aligning with the temple of Suryabinayak temple, there is one more temple, a few steps above the main shrine of Suryabinayak temple. It is called the temple of the mother goddess.

Wondering why people prefer to visit Bhaktapur?
Despite being only 6.889 square kilometers (overall area of Bhaktapur municipality) in size, it is home to multiple temples and WOW monuments. And inside it, there is another tiny space named Bhaktapur Durbar Square that embodies the richness of Newari art, architecture, and history.
Bhaktapur Durbar Square
In Bhaktapur, one may sit for hours on the pedestals of the rest house or the temples, admiring Shalabhanjika’s magnificent stances. Well, Shalabhanjika is a female figure with elegant feminine features standing beside a tree and holding a limb.
With that, the Bhaktapur Durbar Square offers a religious tour along with a historical sightseeing tour as you can see a kind of an equal number of temples and the surviving palaces and monuments over there.
Bhaktapur, an anciently choreographed city, moreover, is also designated as an open museum. Over hereabouts, you can catch sight of the marvelous erections up until the last 18th century.  Amidst them, the then Royal Palace is one of the most attractive temptations of Bhaktapur Durbar Square.
It is said that the first palace in the current Durbar area was built by King Jayasthiti Malla, in the late 13th century. But, there are no remains left of that initial palace which was then named Yuthuniman Rajkula.
Despite that, the current palace still has a lot to show and tell about the history and
the contributions of various kings.
But one thing is certain: it was at its peak during the reign of King Bhupatindra Malla. He turned this, eternal area into a world of fantastic architecture. That’s why it is also enlisted in the UNESCO World Heritage site (1979 A.D) along with the  Changu Narayan temple, one of the oldest temples that exist in Bhaktapur.
Traveling tip: Walking is the best way to discover Bhaktapur.
Always! A walk through narrow alleys, courtyards, residents’ homes, temples, and then the market. It simply is the best way to explore Bhaktapur.

Let’s start from the west edge of the Bhaktapur Durbar Square
Basantapur Chowk
Basantapur Chowk once used to be a place where feasts and royal parties used to take place. But, today we don’t even have its ruins. What we have left in the name of Basantapur Chowk are the statues of two lions and the statues of Bhagwati Ugrachandi and Ugra Bhairav.
It is said that those images were set by King Bhupatindra Malla after the beautification of Basantapur Durbar which used to stand right behind the gates. 
The sculpture of Ugrachandi
Image of Ugrachandi (Bhagwati)
Ugrachandi is well-known as the most furious female deity on earth. As per the meaning of her name, Ugra means more than anything else or limitless and Chandi means the most furious female deity.
But, why is this sculpture means so much?
Her angry-neutral face, nine pairs of hands full of different types of weapons, the posture of slaying a demon, that slaughtered buffalo, then having a position of giving blessings and all those details on one sculpture is no ordinary thing to create.
Perhaps, that’s why it is mounted as one of the most glorious arts of that period.
One who closely had a look at that sculpture would never say that it is not a masterpiece.
The sculpture of Ugra Bhairava
The sculpture of Bhairava stands right behind the sculpture of the Ugrachandi. It was also ordered to erect by King Bhupatindra Malla along with the sculpture of Ugrachandi. Alike as the Ugrachandi, the Bhairava is also known as one of the most fearsome incarnations of Lord Shiva.
Ugra Bhairava
It looks like, it was the best pair of most furious and fearsome deities of that time. Here, the sculpture of Bhairava is no less than Bhagwati’s. Essentially, the locals call the image of her, Ugrachandi Bhagwati, rather than Ugrachandi itself.
The sculpture of Bhairava here is unique since it has seven pairs of hands holding some type of weapon. Plus, the sculpture is showing his control over betals. However, the details of this sculpture do not end here.
The most amusing fact about this sculpture is that the Bhairava over here had embraced himself with the skin of an Elephant. It is carved very smartly.
Your keen eye would gonna find these puzzle-like carvings if you give a minute to read the details of such a sculpture.
Char Dham Temples in Bhaktapur
Char Dham temples are a set of four temples that are considered the site that helps achieve moksha or salvation. In Bhaktapur too, there are four such temples considered the Char Dham temples.
According to Anjan Sharma, the priest of Char Dham temples of Bhaktapur Durbar Square, the temples were then made to facilitate the common people because the actual Char Dham temples are farther from them. Thus, King Bhupatindra Malla insist to make these temples within the arena of Bhaktapur Palace. 
Badrinath temple
Badrinath Temple
Badrinath temple is now reassembled in its initial structure after the quake of 2015. The temple is made in terracotta style and stands right behind the Jagannath temple.
By the sequence, this temple was erected in the 17th century. Unfortunately, the devastating earthquake of 1990B.S. turned this temple into a Nepalese roofing style temple.
It sounds quite weird. But another devastating earthquake in April 2015 brought this temple into its real posture. Today, the temple is again in the same shape (in the Shikhara style) as it was originally built.
Jagannath temple
Jagannath temple
Jagannath temple is one of the four temples of Char Dham. It looks very common though it has one unique thing which makes it different from other temples.
The statue of Lord Krishna, Balrama, and their sister Subhadra, the images of these statues are quite unusual as they were made out of wood and have such big beautiful eyes.
If you also wish to capture those images, then you must reach there at the time of Nitya puja, daily worship. It normally happens from 7-8 am.
Rameshwor Temple
Rameshwor Temple
Rameshwor temple is one such temple of Bhaktapur Durbar Square that has neither doors nor walls. It only has a Chaturmukhi Shivalinga which represents the Rameshwaram temple of India.
Radhakrishna Temple
Radhakrishna temple (often called Dwarikanath) is the only temple that is made in Nepalese pagoda form among the Char Dham temples. It also has the statues of Lord Krishna with Radha, not Subhadra. And, those statues are made of black stone which particularly might be perfect for the carving of those statues.
It just suits them.
Radha Krishna Temple
You can have their glimpse too if you can make it during its Nitya Puja. Besides the temple represents different forms of Lord Krishna in the formation of strut woodcarvings that you won’t be able to take your eyes off from it, at least for a while.
Well, these four temples are the Char Dham of Bhaktapur Durbar Square. However, people often get confused over actual Char Dham temples since there are five temples in a row including Kedarnath Temple.
Kedarnath Temple
The Kedarnath Temple look-alike like the Badrinath Temple since both of them are made in terracotta form. The temple is called Kedarnath because of the Statue of Kedaraeshwor.
Kedarnath temple
This 17th-century old temple is so eye-satisfying through its eastern pedestal, you can observe the entire durbar area along with the rest house and temple of Vatsala Durga Temple. While from the western or the front pedestal of the temple, you can have a glimpse of the entire Char Dham temple.
On the same lane, you can see a large rest house on top of which is a restaurant. That large rest house is called Yetachapari.
It was quite spacious before the earthquake of 1934 A.D. Unfortunately, the earthquake of 1934 made more temples and palaces of Durbar Square disappear under the ground.
Yetachapari during 1932-1934
Bhandarkhal Chowk
Bhaktapur Durbar Square once used to have 99 courtyards but it is now left behind with some 12 or 13 courtyards. And, Bhandarkhal Chowk is one of them. The chowk is locally called Bhandakha chowk, officially named after the Bhandarpukhu, which is a pond centered on that courtyard. Do you know why it is called Bhandakhapukhu?
Bhanda pukhu inside the Bhandarkhal chwok
The Chowk was said to be the treasury of the state. Besides, it has a mysterious series of stone carvings on the western part of the pond. Some say the stone carving tells a story, related to the ducks and tortoise.
And, yes the entrance of this pond, don’t miss to check that out cause it is the most unique part of the whole Bhaktapur Durbar Square.  The entrance foremost is the only gate that is made out of entirely stone in the entire Durbar Square.
The National Art Museum
The northern alley of the waylays after Bhandarkha Chowk, leads you toward the National Art Museum. This is the only gallery that is treasuring sculptures dating back to the Malla and Lichhavi periods.
National art museum
The museum is home to collections of manuscripts, and paintings of the Malla Ruling era. Plus, it also has the remains of statues from the 1934s destroyed temples. While the gallery itself is the face of the Royal Palace, Simhadhwoka, it is worth sneaking around in it.
With those lions, two more stone images are standing in front of the door, facing south. They are the images of Hanumanta Bhairav ( left) and Narasimha (right).
Statues of Narshima and Hanuman
The statue of Hanumanta Bhairava and Narasimha. These statues are placed right in front of the doors of Simhadwaka Durbar (Currently the National Art Museum), accompanied by two giant lions. By which the name of the palace became Simhadhwoka Durbar means the palace with lions on the gate.
Hanumante Bhairava
Statue of Narasimha
These two images were also anchored up by King Bhupatindra Malla which today, somehow attests to us about the effects of having an affair with stone images. As you can observe, the statue of Narasimha is worshipped regularly, thus it looks quite shabby. 
But on the other hand, the images of Hanuman which are neither worshipped nor touched seem in good condition to this date. Moreover, there is a reason behind establishing these statues and scarce worshipping the image of Hanuman.
Don’t forget to ask about these things to your guide.
The Golden Gate
The Golden gate
Moving toward the east from the National Art Museum would lead you to the outstanding drafting, the golden gate. The golden gate, also known as the Swarnadwar is the last masterpiece left by the last Malla king and reign, King Ranjit Malla.
Though it was the decisive contribution of the Malla reign, it was the best creation of that period.
The replica of Taleju, the symbols of Astamatrika, Purna Kalash (the symbol of good fortune), the Nepalese roofing style, the Ganesha temple, and the current national flag of Nepal. The gate looks like a complete package, filled with Nepalese architecture, carvings, symbols, temples, inscriptions, and noticeable spangles.
So, it’s worth having a glimpse over there before you enter the palace.
55 Window palace
55 Window Palace
Entering the golden gate would lead you to another master of works of woodcarvings,  55 Window Palace. The palace is best known for its fifty-five beautifully engraved windows.
Inspiring which the palace was named Pachpane Jhyale Durbar by the Shah ruler who already was in name Nye Nyeppa Jhya Layaku.
Today, the palace offers us the great wall paintings of the Malla era along with the most immeasurable wood carving of Bhaktapur Durbar Square.
Did you know that this 55 Window Palace once was used as the post office of the city? Don’t forget to have a closer look at the woodcarving of this palace.
Past Post Office of Bhaktapur
Mulchowk
Taleju Temple of Bhaktapur Durbar Square beholds the most powerful tantric deity and is considered the holiest shrine of Bhaktapur. Mulchwok, where the Taleju temple lies as a bar is the most sacred place of the palace where non-Hindus are not allowed to enter.
Even for the locals, some strict rules need to be followed to enter there. Like taking off shoes, prohibiting photography, not wearing leather, and must leave each belonging like bags, right in front of the door.
The Mul chowk then leads to another chowk named Dribhajuchowk through a narrow dark alley. The Chowk has a small pond named Ajima, the Dribhaju Pokhari, or Dwinmaju Pokhari.
Dwinmaju Pokhari
Dwinmaju Pukhu, you can call a secret pond of the Bhaktapur Durbar Square since it lies within the northwest part of the palace and one must cross through the Mulchwok to reach there. And, not everyone is allowed to the Mulchwok.
Therefore, only Hindu people could enter there.
There is a belief that taking bath in this pond can cure ailments like loss of appetite and malnutrition among infants.
Lunhiti Chowk
Luhiti Chowk (Sundhara)
An open tap named Lunhiti means the golden conduit (Sundhara). Yet, the courtyard is more notable than Nagpokhari. That is definitely because of its presentation. You can witness a beautiful stone sculpture of a snake, all cut into pieces, and a pond that has the presence of a stone snake.
However, the water of the pond is not favorable to touch or play with. It’s green and quite uncommon too.
It is also counted as one of the courtyards of the palace which was erected during the reign of King Jitmitra Malla. It is said that it took 10 years to complete this spout.
The Statue of King Bhupatindra Malla
When you get out of the golden gate, you’ll face the statue of King Bhupatindra Malla facing toward Taleju temple. This statue shows respect toward Taleju rather than a king’s self-image.
King Bhupatindra Malla
Also, it depicts the king as a devotee since he is facing north, toward the temple. Today, when we transpired in Bhaktapur Durbar Square, most of us might not notice the statue and its devotional position, of course.
But, in the evening, from the pedestal of 55 window palaces, you couldn’t deny saying that the statue looks much more beautiful than anything else at Bhaktapur Durbar Square. It’s just pristine.
Isn’t it interesting talking about the kings and their stories? Well, we have another article about the Malla Kings of Bhaktapur. You can check that out too.
Besides these monuments, there is still some more to explore in Bhaktapur Durbar Square.
Vastala Durga Temple
Vatsala Durga Temple
Vatsala Durga temple is the white elegance of Bhaktapur Durbar Square. It looks more like the Krishna Mandir of Patan but it’s not the one. It is the temple of Tantric Shakti, Durga that in the form of Sri Yantra.
You can see a Kalash as the representation of Vatsala Durga in the temple which was possibly possible to observe only after the quake of April 2015. Before that, the temple used to be locked and people be like totally unknown of what is inside this temple.
Besides, the temple has a barking bell hung right in front of it accompanying the beautiful stone creatures’ elephants, and lions. The anecdote says that dogs start to bark and whine when it rings. The barking bell was established there by King Bhupatindra Malla in 1721 A.D. while he rehabilitated the temple.
Pashupatinath Temple
The Pashupatinath Temple or the Yakheshwor Temple of Bhaktapur have some similarities as well as a difference to the genuine temple of Pashupatinath, which lies in Kathmandu Valley. The temple was erected by King Yakshya Malla. Accordingly, the name of the temple ended up as Yakshyeshwor Mahadev temple.
Pashupatinath temple
Despite that, it is considered one of the oldest temples of Bhaktapur. The temple is one among those which have some erotic carvings. It is believed that the then king made make that kind of carvings to give sex education to the locals.
Plus, there is another belief that tells that those kinds of carving prevent temples from thunderbolt strikes.
Chyasalin Mandap
Chyasalin Mandap. PC: Prasant Prajapati
Chayalin mandap is not a temple. It was built to receive guests and attend different occasions by royal personalities. Yet, more stories tell it was made to stop the aurora of Pashupatinath which was slightly direct to the Royal Palace.
And it is still assumed to not be a good sign to have direct sight of a temple in front of any residence in Bhaktapur. So, people made an alternate architecture to avoid that aurora.
That’s why the Chyasalim mandap rests right in between the Pashupatinath temple and 55 windowed palaces.
Shankar Narayan temple
Shankharnarayan temple
Shankar Narayan temple is one small, dome-like temple that lies on the southeast side of the 55-window palace of Bhaktapur Durbar Square. Though the temple is not such notable, once in a time, it used to have a beautiful stone image of Harihar (the combined form of Lord Shiva and Vishnu).
Siddhi Laxmi Temple
Siddhi Laxmi temple of Bhaktapur Durbar Square is also called Lohan Dega, the stone temple. The temple is as beautiful as the Vatsala Durga temple but undoubtedly has more guardians.
As per some folk talks, the very first pair of guardians of the temple is related to then’s society and human behavior. It simply shows what happens when a child is raised by a father or a mother. The difference is shown there, all you need to do is go and find it.
Siddhi Laxmi temple
Annapurna Temple
Temple of Annapurna. PC: Prasant Prajapati
Right behind the temple of Siddhi Laxmi, often called Lohan Dega, there is one unusual temple. Most of you might have noticed it, a temple where the supposed doors are filled with brick walls.
There is even conflict about its name. Some people call it Siddhi Laxmi temple, some say there is Annapurna inside the temple, and some claim that there is a Sriyantra which is a tantric symbol of Goddess Vatsala Devi.
Phasidegal temple
Phasidegal was once claimed as the tallest temple of Bhaktapur Durbar Square, even of the entire Bhaktapur Nagar, and that once upon a time was the time before the emergence of Nyatapola. Well, there are a lot of rumors related to these two temples. You must catch one local guide of Bhaktapur if you wanna know more and more about such stories and uncovered mysteries of Bhaktapur. 
Coming back to the temple, this temple is called Phasidega because it looks like a pumpkin. Yes, here Phasi means the Pumpkin and Dega means the god. Though the temple is often called Silu Mahadev and Ta: Ja Dega.
Phasidegal
This temple is being reconstructed with local funds after the damaging earthquake of 2015. And it no longer has pumpkin-like architecture.
Lapandegal
Yes, the stone lions. Generally, they are called Lapandegal, which means an obstacle on the road. But they weren’t before the earthquake of 1934. There was a temple of Harihar and those lions were the guards of that temple.
stone_lions (Lanpandegal)
Unfortunately, the temple collapsed in the quake. And, left those lions in between the road, making a beautiful obstacle.
Kumari house (Tadhuchhen Bahal)
The Kumari House of Bhaktapur. PC: Prasant Prajapati
Kumari House ( the house of the living goddess), lies quite distant from Durbar Square. But one can have a visit over there after roaming in and around Bhaktapur Durbar Square.
It’s not that far, for instance. The eastern way right after the end of the large resthouse, that’s it.
A Hiti at Bhaktapur Durbar Square
Bhaktapur Durbar Square hiti. PC: Prasant Prajapati
And the Durbar Square Hiti (a stone tap) at the end of the row. It is on the premises of Bhaktapur Durbar Square.
Remember the Chyasalin Mandap and the Vastala Durga Temple, the conduit endures behind them. The old is among the oldest taps of Bhaktapur.
In conclusion, this spiffing durbar square bequeathed you full of stories. From monuments to the pillars of the chapel, every piece of art had a spellbinding anecdote.

Ways to reach Bhaktapur Durbar Square from Kathmandu
Few ways that would easily navigate you to the Bhaktapur Durbar area.
Bhaktapur buses leave from the Ratna Park Bus Stand and Bagbazar Bus Stand. Better to take a bus that goes to Kamalbinayak Bus Park from Bagbazar Bus Stand. It would be great if you find the one which passes the Shiddhapokhari. Get off the bus when you reach Sano Byasi, the Tourist Bus Park of Bhaktapur. Bus charges are around Rs 35-50. From there, you have to walk for a bit to reach Durbar Square. Asking any residents would be a great help though, just walk straight until you find a staircase (behind a temple of Indrayani). Following that way, you would reach Durbar Square Gate within 3-4 minutes.
By any chance, you took the wrong bus. Even then, you don’t have to worry about it. All you need to do is get off at the Suryabinayak Bus Stop. And then, walk toward the east until you find a way to wave toward the north. Just follow the same route, and cross the bridge, with that you would pass the alleys of pottery square, then Taumadhi Square and finally you will reach Bhaktapur Durbar Square.
Anywhere from Kathmandu, you can take a taxi. The normal taxi charge from Tribhuvan International Airport is around Rs.1000. The taxi drivers may ask for up to Rs 1500. And yes, you can bargain, if you can 🙂

Events and festivals celebrated in Dattatraya Square
For the reason that it is situated quite far from the Bhaktapur Durbar Square, most people prefer to visit this place at least. However, being the ultimate square to be visited too, it again gives a bunch of surprises to its visitors. This square is named after the Dattatraya temple, where Dattatraya, a part of the trinity is worshipped. 
Dattatraya temple
As the other squares of Bhaktapur, this sort of place is also filled with minor and major temples. If you walk north from this temple, you’ll see a Salan Ganesh temple and behind it a giant manmade pond dedicated to Lord Ganesh. The pond is called Ganesh pokhari.
Salan Ganesh Temple and the pond
Within the area of Dattatraya Square, there are three more temples that hold both cultural and religious paramount. Among them,  this Salan Ganesh Temple has immense importance. During different festivals and events like Gai jatra, the temple is embraced by the devotees.
Salan Ganesh temple
The temple holds an image of Lord Ganesh, but, yes, it is not a sculpture. And that thing makes it quite unique from others. The image is rooted in a natural stone that has a symbolic form of Ganesha or the elephant-headed image. The Salan Ganesh is also sub-titled as the Adhi Ganesh among the asta Ganesh. Sumerialy, it dates back to 1654. 
The pond behind the Salan Ganesha Temple is said to be dedicated to the temple. That’s why it is named the Ganesha pokhari. Some people somehow also called it Yatachhen pukhu. Consequently, the eve made this pond fill with young people as well as the old ones.
Salan Ganesh pokhari
There is another temple in front of the Dattatraya temple, named after the bhimsen temple. Bhimsen is said to be the god of trade. 
Bhimsen temple and the pokhari
There are still several temples and heritage sites in Bhaktapur which has no evidence of their existence. Yet, they are standing in front of us, secreting their history somewhere else. No one accurately knows about it. In those dusting and busts, the erection of the Bhimsen temple also got faded.
Bhimsen Temple
Somehow, archaeologists presume, it was erected in 1605 CE. This two-floored rectangular pagoda locates right in front of the Dattatreya Temple. Plus, it was renovated lately, by the year 2018.
As the name of the temple assumes, it is the temple of lord Bhimsen. Bhimsen, a god with a red face, angry eyes, and a thick dark moustache. He is worshipped as the god of trade and commerce. Perhaps, because of that, every household has had its portrait, especially in the Kathmandu Valley. 
Bhimsen_merchant
PC: Wikipedia
With the temple, a conduit is attached, right in its back. That is a conduit but it is denoted as a pond. That’s why that conduit is called Bhimsen pokhari. Meanwhile, there are no shreds of evidence about this conduit too.
Laxmi Narayan temple
An ever-closed small temple of the premises of Dattatraya temple is the temple of Laxmi Narayan Temple. The temple is dedicated to Lord Narayan and Goddess Laxmi. The temple locates in the northern core of the square.
Laxminarayan temple
These temples had their consequences, besides these temples, two more things made this square so valuable, The woodcarving museum and the brass and bronze museum.
These museums have a large collection of woodcarvings as well as metal craftsmanship of the ancient Bhaktapur kingdom respectively.
Brass and bronze Museum
Brass and Bronze museum
The museum next to the woodcarving museum was also math. The then math, which is now representing a bunch of cases, is all related to the metalwork. And it comes under the name of Brass and Bronze Museum. However, one can enter this museum with the same ticket bought either in the National Art Gallery or the Woodcarving Museum.
The museum is filled with ancient exemplars. Just like the other museum does. But, it significantly has preserved the traditional metalworks. That includes the ceremonial lamps as well as the ritual vessels, which also make it unique from others. In some summon, it is also facing the problems of weaker lighting means.
Wood Carving Museum
Woodcarving museum
The then pujari math of Tachupal Chowk now is a more renowned museum of Bhaktapur. The wood carving museum, which originally came into existence during the reign of King Yakshya Malla. With the most epigraphic temple of Bhaktapur, The Dattatraya Temple.
After the blessing of King Yakshya Malla, it was by some means rebuilt in 1763. And again renovated by the German experts as the wedding gift to the then King Birendra in 1979.
The peacock window, being the most alluring woodcraft from the 15th century, even today made us come for it. A narrow street facing south leads to this masterpiece. However, it also had to face adversity like catching fire.
The museum, of course, with the dark rooms and brazen woodcraft showcases the then wood carvings. Nearby, there are some mini souvenir shops with miniature wooden peacock windows. And the brass and bronze museum to share the ticket, for instance. However, the earthquake of 2015 made the museum quite terrible.
But, it’s worthy enough to widen your eyes for the classics.
Peacock window
There is again one spectacular thing left behind in all these things, the very famous peacock window. You need to adopt a narrow street to reach that place, where you can slacken and peacefully adore the decorative window. Don’t get confused, it’s in the same building as a woodcarving museum.
All you need to do is get out of the museum, then head east, passing the souvenir shop just turn right. And there you go. Cheer your chin up and there is it, the world-famous peacock window.

Each year, on the fourth day of Biska Jatra (the last day of the Nepalese New Year), a sacred puja used to hold over there. The Kapalik people(Nath community) used to worship the statue of Goraknath, whom they idolised as their chief mentor.

About the Latarambeshwor Temple
Well, the architecture of the temple is recently concluded, which really is so fascinating.
It is said that it took about eighteen years to complete this structure of the temple. At first, the locals, by themselves collected the money to build the temple which later on was supported by the local government and thus this outstanding result came out.
It is an open temple, but unlike other temples that you find in Bhaktapur, it seems a little distinct. The foremost part of the temple is erected using bricks, even in those segments where normally, the wood is used like, in the windows.
The seven pinnacles and other miniature statues of Ganesha, Durga, and Saraswati on whirls of the temple give you a vibe of peacefulness and a complete shrine.

Kalamasi is a very petite agriculture-based village which by acquisitions comes under the Changunarayan Municipality. But it loves to be designated as a village that endures under the western lap of Nagarkot.
The village stays far away from the hustle and bustle of the Kathmandu Valley and is still managing its purity. There are still village settlements, agriculture, and nature, foremost. 
Within the periphery of Kalamsi, there are many more renowned sites of Bhaktapur like the Saraswati temple (the locals of Bhaktapur call it Lashapakhe ), where every year Hindu devotees come to worship Goddess Saraswati and Buddhist comes to Worship Maha Manjushri. 
Along with that, there is Muhan Pokhari, one of the finest weekend destinations which as a matter of the season, blanks out in the winter season. Yet it is quite popular among today’s generations.
In between these tranquil, there is Kalamasi, which has one of the best gifts of nature, the bojini dam and picnic spot.
Historical background of the Kalamasi lake
Bojii dam site was a small pond then and a capacious playground. According to the local people, it was a tremendous place with no use at all. There were no fields nor it was used for any other purpose. So, it used to be called Bajo Jamin. Synonymously, it means a free grassland.
Later on, Bajo Jamin transmitted it into Bojini. And came to existence as the Bojini Damsite and Picnic Spot. However, it is also titled the hidden lake of Nagarkot.
Archeologically, there is no important historical background of the destination. Besides, it was a small village before and momentarily too. But a shred of evidence and a word of the local somehow connects it with history. As per the inquiry, there used to be a grinding mill near the bojini pond. There is no exact conformity but it is said that the grinding mill was built after the then ruling queen ordered it to do so. A specific study might analyze whether it was made in the king’s ruling or Rana’s ruling era.
Furthermore, the present dam site area and the then Bojini pond was a natural swimming pool. The local people used it as a natural pool while foraging to the cows and other domestic animals.

The religious aspect of Changu
The Changu Narayan Temple, according to the evidence, is Nepal’s oldest temple, with distinctive construction and religious beliefs.
Hindus from many parts of the world frequently visit this location. Haribodhini Ekadashi, Naag Panchami, Janai Purnima, Mahashanan, Jugadi Navami, and other festivals attract them. Aside from that, the locals do their daily pujas there.
The legends
If there is a major religious site in Nepal that has no mythology associated with it, then you must be missing something. Yes, in Nepal, it is so obvious that every holy place has at least one story related to its emergence.
And this is where the story of Changu begins…
According to the legend, once a brahmin named Sudarshan traded out his cow to a cow herder (gwala). When the gwala bought her, he started to graze her in the champak forest because of the good availability of green grasses and plants over there.
He had a thought as if he fed her good grasses, she’ll honour him with a good amount of milk. But, that thing anonymously never happens to him. He continued grazing her in the forest. But, the result wasn’t satisfying for him. He always got a tiny portion of milk.
He was so disappointed, thus decided to call Brahmin Sudarshan. As soon as the gwala call him, Sudarshan gave his attendance at the gwala’s place where the gwala describes all his problems to the brahmin. Considering the words of gwala, both of them decide to go and check out the activities of the cow.
As per the planning, they followed the cow while grazing. Surprisingly, they saw a very unnatural incident. They saw a black shaded boy egressing out of an old champak tree and drinking the milk from the cow.
After observing all these things, there were sure that the boy is no human. Perhaps they think he could be the devil. That’s why they decided to cut down that tree from where he egressed and did so. But, the tree starts to bleed as they cut it.
That incident made them so anxious that they started to cry aloud and asked for forgiveness. In the meantime, Lord Vishnu or the Narayan appeared in front of them and explained everything about these incidents.
He explained that he was cursed when he accidentally murdered the Sudarshan’s father during his hunt. He was tugged over there since then. And, forthwith was freed from all his sins, because of them.
Subsequently, hearing all these things, they finally got some relief on their faces. Afterwards, they established a small temple in that arena and worshipped it as the Changu Narayan temple. Where the descendants of Sudarshan brahmin continues to become priest and descendants of the gwala continues to be guthiyars.
Things to do in Changu
As we now, know that Changu is such a complex composition of nature, culture, and modern lifestyle. Your choice of being there could make you do so many things like:

Hiking is the best thing that Changu can offer after religious realization, of course. A one-day short hike, that you can start from Nagarkot or the Bhaktapur Durbar area. You can also choose to continue your hike to Nagarkot via telkot if you start your hike from the Nagar. The rural-urban, mixing villages, terraced fields, and jungles always welcome you on your hike. Besides the flanking breeze.

However, it also covers a little portion of the jungle of Suryabinayak, since it is a part of Suryabinayak Municipality. With that, this place is all congested with hills and grasslands.

Chaling and the legend behind its name
Perhaps, this could be one of the reasons for its growth too. Here, you can find several temples. From east to west, as well as from North to the South, there are walls of the temples.
However, most of them are in a rustic environment. So, you can prefer to have a hike over there. By the way, this site is not that far. It is only 20km remote from the capital of Nepal, Kathmandu.

Besides all those temples, this place beholds the beauty of nature. The greenery around you simply gratifies your eyes. People over there seem more engaging in agriculture. But, it was the hub for the production of animal skin and leather materials during the 18th century.
Chaling and the legend behind its name
There are a lot of perceptions about the naming of Chaling. As per one legend, in ancient time, Chaling, before being a village, there used to be a hill named Chaling Dada. From where the wave of water used to flow.  The wave of water in the Nepalese language is called “Chal”. Thus, the place from which the “Chal” is flown is then named Chaling.
Another legend says that there was a dense setup of Tamang people in Chaling and they used to bring/eat meat from Tibbet and Kavrepalanchowk but the skin of such animals was traded in the valley. In their language (In the language of Tamang people), the work of chopping and cleaning animal skin is called Chali. And, from the word, Chali the place is started to call Chaling.
Moreover, there is one more legend left. As per which, the local of that place used to cattle a lot of buffalo. But there was not a good market available for dairy products. That’s why they used to serve the cream that flows over the milk while boiling the milk to their guests.
That flowing cream in the Nepalese language is called “Tar” or the “Chali”. You could probably guess by now. Consequently, because of the Chali that the villagers used to serve and eat, the place began to call Chaling.
Also, there is a saying in the chronicle about this place. That identifies the ancient name of this site, as Gopal Dranga. It was the name mentioned in Kirat and lichhavi era.
