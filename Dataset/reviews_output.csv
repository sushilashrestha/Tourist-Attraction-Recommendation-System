Visiting Nepal for the first time, I made sure to include **Bhaktapur Durbar Square** on my travel list. Known for its **rich heritage and historical significance**, this iconic site in the Kathmandu Valley truly lived up to its reputation as one of Nepal’s must-visit destinations.

From the moment I entered the square, I was captivated by its **wonderful charm**. The intricate architecture of the ancient temples, palaces, and courtyards speaks volumes about Nepal’s glorious past. The atmosphere was **lively and bustling with tourists** from around the globe, all eager to soak in the beauty of this UNESCO World Heritage Site.

One of the highlights of my visit was trying my hand at **pottery making**. Bhaktapur is famous for its traditional pottery, and joining a local artisan at his wheel was an unforgettable experience. Though my creation was far from perfect, the joy of crafting something with my own hands made it all worthwhile.

Another treat that I couldn’t resist was the famous **Juju Dhau**, or “King of Yogurts.” This creamy, sweet delight lived up to its name and instantly became one of my favorite Nepali treats. It’s a must-try for anyone visiting Bhaktapur!

I also took my time to explore every **nook and cranny of the narrow streets**, which were filled with local shops, art galleries, and handicrafts. One of my best finds was a beautifully crafted **Kashmiri shawl**, a perfect souvenir to remember my trip by.

Bhaktapur Square isn’t just a historical site; it’s a living, breathing cultural hub. The combination of ancient heritage, vibrant markets, and friendly locals creates an experience that’s truly unique. If you’re visiting Kathmandu, don’t miss this **wonderful place**.

Later, during Ashoka's reign, because of the spread of Buddhism, this shrine might have been converted into a Buddhist shrine. The temple was a Buddhist shrine till the 8th century and Adi Shankara revived the shrine and converted it to a Hindu temple.[7][10] The architecture of the temple resembling that of a Buddhist vihara (temple) and the brightly painted facade which is atypical of Buddhist temples leads to the argument.[2] Other accounts relate that it was originally established as a pilgrimage site by Adi Shankara in the ninth century. It is believed that Shankara resided in the place for six years from 814 to 820 CE. He resided six months in Badrinath and the rest of the year in Kedarnath. Hindu followers assert that he discovered the deity of Badrinath in the Alaknanda River and enshrined it in a cave near the Tapt Kund hot springs.[8][11] A traditional story asserts that Adi Shankara expelled all the Buddhists in the region with the help of the Parmar ruler king Kanak Pal. The hereditary successors of the king governed the temple and endowed villages to meet its expenses. The income from a set of villages on the route to the temple was used to feed and accommodate pilgrims. The Parmar rulers held the title ""Bolanda Badrinath"", meaning speaking Badrinath. They had other titles, including Shri 108 Basdrishcharyaparayan Garharaj Mahimahendra, Dharmabibhab, and Dharamarakshak Sigamani.[12]
The throne of Badrinath was named after the presiding deity; the king enjoyed ritual obeisance by the devotees before proceeding to the shrine. The practice was continued until the late 19th century.[12] During the 16th century, the King of Garhwal moved the murti to the present temple.[8] When the state of Garhwal was divided, the Badrinath temple came under British rule but the king of Garhwal continued as the chairman of the management committee. The selection of priest is done after consultation between Garhwal and Travancore royal families.[12]","https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNAwXZGXioqfGgrJrUMDZIHvp-hIRleHatrHfUb=w300-h225-p-k-no, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPwtwU1xPjLi9EztSreNEYDaktCQyWxQncG_MNB=w300-h225-p-k-no, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOjQGypEr7egglkTKE0fjiSIoJd3tA87afABecL=w300-h225-p-k-no, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMuyMfb57mR024UcBGuVgfSdbWsqOMhJm8oae7U=w300-h225-p-k-no",0

Facilities for pilgrims are fairly well maintained but a bit of experience with high altitude and unpredictable weather will be of help. Locals are friendly and will guide you properly while walking.

Overall, Kedarnath Temple is somewhere one must visit to realize spiritual solace or just to experience the grandeur of the Himalayas. All said, just make sure to plan your trip well.

The Sculptures of Shive found in both shrines are 4,000 years old. Even a stone scripture found in Doleshwor was written in Sanskrit and Old Nepalese. The priests in both shrines are selected from India's southern states of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and Tamil Nadu. Both priests affix the word ‘ling’ after their names to convey their proximity to the god as his worshipper and both temples have a cluster of five Shiva shrines. The main deity of both priests is Birbhadra, a companion of Shiva, according to Hindu scriptures.","https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN28rj--0N-2ESw0NKXY3jt_blm0AlgE4MaiSBw=w300-h225-p-k-no, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNeoE0wQ25LxwGiFUnej2clIJcDiEtte5Tw__TF=w300-h225-p-k-no, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMIzegt0OBv8byLVbH4I4MLtATwqZ27CHvf_g0x=w300-h225-p-k-no, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM0lp1-8oSL7HDpMmYK7_l43D5CT_Tv-Qxfs_tA=w300-h225-p-k-no",2

Even worse, the committee responsible for maintaining the temple seems more focused on collecting donations than actually ensuring the temple and its surroundings are clean. With all the money that comes in, you would think they’d invest in basic cleaning services, but it seems like their pockets take priority over the temple’s upkeep.

Muktinath Temple, a sacred site for both Hindus and Buddhists, is located in the Mustang district of Nepal at an altitude of 3,710 meters in the Himalayan range. Known as ""Mukti Kshetra,"" meaning ""place of liberation,"" it is a revered pilgrimage destination attracting devotees from Nepal, India, and beyond. The temple is dedicated to Lord Vishnu in Hindu tradition and Avalokiteshvara in Buddhist belief, symbolizing a unique confluence of religious harmony.

The temple’s architecture is modest yet spiritually significant, with a pagoda-style structure surrounded by breathtaking landscapes of the Annapurna mountain range. A key feature of Muktinath is the 108 sacred water spouts shaped like bulls’ heads, known as ""Muktidhara."" Pilgrims bathe under these spouts, believing it cleanses them of sins. Adjacent to the temple is the eternal flame, or ""Jwala Mai,"" fueled by natural gas, a phenomenon held sacred by both faiths.

Accessible via a challenging trek or helicopter ride, the journey to Muktinath is considered a part of the pilgrimage. The area is also rich in cultural significance, with monasteries, prayer wheels, and stone-carved deities adding to its spiritual aura. The nearby Kali Gandaki River is renowned for Shaligram stones, considered manifestations of Lord Vishnu. The temple operates year-round, though the peak season is from March to October.","https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOzUYg5sdDywRDSHIV6xGv8jtzEc4qgKFaDNfGc=w300-h450-p-k-no, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNwyNCkJDfVFWl2fx4JhH9zGq2ERSh3fMCmhW1a=w300-h225-p-k-no, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPd6T_0nrqddlTbrenecDWPLb1C3mTmNp5McH6R=w300-h225-p-k-no",1

Tal Barahi Temple, also known as Barahi Temple, is a small yet significant Hindu temple located on a tiny island in the middle of Phewa Lake in Pokhara, Nepal. Dedicated to the goddess Durga, who is worshipped in her boar incarnation, this temple is one of the most important religious sites in Pokhara and a popular destination for both pilgrims and tourists.

Accessible only by boat, the journey to Tal Barahi Temple is as much a part of the experience as the visit itself. As you approach the temple by crossing the serene waters of Phewa Lake, surrounded by the stunning backdrop of the Annapurna mountain range, you get a sense of the temple’s unique and tranquil setting. The island is small and lush, with the temple at its center, providing a peaceful and reflective environment for worship.

The temple’s architecture is simple, featuring a traditional pagoda style, which is typical of Nepalese religious structures. Despite its modest size, Tal Barahi Temple plays a central role in the spiritual life of the local community, hosting various religious ceremonies and festivals throughout the year, particularly during the Dashain festival, when the temple sees an influx of devotees.

While the temple is primarily a place of worship, it also draws many visitors who are captivated by its picturesque location and the sense of serenity it offers. However, the area can get busy during peak tourist seasons, and the small size of the island means that space can be limited.

Tal Barahi Temple is not just a religious site but also a serene retreat that offers visitors a moment of peace amidst the natural beauty of Pokhara. Whether you are drawn by its spiritual significance or simply by the stunning setting, a visit to Tal Barahi Temple is a memorable part of any trip to Pokhara.","https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNSzgX-LmObI27qYkTwNOG4qwDO2gMz4W24tC8K=w300-h450-p-k-no, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPEamO5oMpAWnkF8ZlzEr-s33BQQGhGRxK1vlZd=w300-h450-p-k-no",1

The architecture of the museum itself is a masterpiece. The building, a part of the former royal palace complex, blends traditional Newar design with modern restoration techniques. Its red brick facade, ornately carved wooden windows, and open courtyards reflect the grandeur of Nepal's Malla period. The museum's galleries are thoughtfully curated, offering detailed explanations about the historical, cultural, and religious significance of each artifact.

Beyond its exhibits, the museum provides visitors with insights into the philosophical and spiritual traditions of the region. Interactive displays and informative panels make it an engaging experience for both locals and international tourists.

This enormous stone idol of Kaal Bhairav stands as a symbol of justice and power in Nepalese culture.

Here are some key details about **Kaal Bhairav** in Kathmandu:

1. **Depiction**: Kaal Bhairav is depicted as a fearsome form of Lord Shiva, with a wrathful expression, holding a severed head in one hand and weapons in others. He is often surrounded by snakes, skulls, and other symbolic elements representing death and destruction. This fierce form is believed to protect the righteous and punish wrongdoers.

2. **Historical and Religious Significance**: The Kaal Bhairav idol is said to date back to the 12th century, although some believe it may have been created even earlier. It holds deep religious importance in both Hinduism and local traditions, where Kaal Bhairav is worshipped as the protector of the Kathmandu Valley.

3. **Role in Justice**: In the past, the statue played a role in the legal system. People who were accused of crimes would be brought before the Kaal Bhairav idol to swear oaths of innocence. It was believed that those who lied would face immediate divine punishment.

4. **Location**: The statue is situated in an open courtyard of **Hanuman Dhoka Durbar Square**, which is itself a historically significant palace complex. The Kaal Bhairav statue is easily recognizable due to its massive size (approximately 12 feet tall) and striking appearance.

5. **Cultural Importance**: Locals and visitors alike pay their respects to Kaal Bhairav, offering flowers, vermillion powder, and other traditional offerings. The site remains an important place of worship, particularly during festivals.

The **Kaal Bhairav** statue continues to draw both devotees and tourists, serving as a reminder of the deep spiritual and historical heritage embedded within Kathmandu Durbar Square.","https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOU6_quEMcivqVWGtrUqTRAqp_h6W6JYKmmjao=w300-h225-p-k-no, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOT_Goz4fXdRG3gpHOTJjWIcgTBQ5fKmwMmdY0=w300-h225-p-k-no, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMwjzfwc6UPWAFxpx9YdcwXSJNwbwdsTCBAw8k=w300-h225-p-k-no, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMdIf5Z0qgue-lFjZspX6m6w1-SteVQ3ormg3o=w300-h225-p-k-no",0

One of the highlights of my visit was trying my hand at **pottery making**. Bhaktapur is famous for its traditional pottery, and joining a local artisan at his wheel was an unforgettable experience. Though my creation was far from perfect, the joy of crafting something with my own hands made it all worthwhile.

Another treat that I couldn’t resist was the famous **Juju Dhau**, or “King of Yogurts.” This creamy, sweet delight lived up to its name and instantly became one of my favorite Nepali treats. It’s a must-try for anyone visiting Bhaktapur!

I also took my time to explore every **nook and cranny of the narrow streets**, which were filled with local shops, art galleries, and handicrafts. One of my best finds was a beautifully crafted **Kashmiri shawl**, a perfect souvenir to remember my trip by.

Bhaktapur Square isn’t just a historical site; it’s a living, breathing cultural hub. The combination of ancient heritage, vibrant markets, and friendly locals creates an experience that’s truly unique. If you’re visiting Kathmandu, don’t miss this **wonderful place**. It’s a treasure trove of history and culture that will leave you with memories to cherish forever!","https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN2HcIZhQEC2Q9jRMB-0q9IQ0zfoLhBwu8nN6us=w300-h225-p-k-no, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO0sqAy_ykr2p5O3fQFW-KT46MiKxbaO20T-vvW=w300-h225-p-k-no, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM_jBDlryJ2WtefRl580Rn9koerZ84dpum_V6UR=w300-h225-p-k-no, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPzqxMNCwftPOW8hcgal25Ft-J62Uz6koRuz2Nj=w300-h225-p-k-no",0

This ornate, three-story structure is the residence of the Kumari, a young girl believed to be the living embodiment of the Hindu goddess Taleju. The tradition of the Kumari, a centuries-old practice, is deeply rooted in Nepalese culture, where the chosen girl, usually from the Newar Shakya caste, is worshipped as a goddess until she reaches puberty.

The Kumari Ghar itself is a striking example of traditional Newari architecture, with its intricately carved wooden windows and doors, and a richly decorated courtyard. The building was constructed in 1757 by King Jaya Prakash Malla and has since been the residence of the Kumari. The most famous of the windows is the one from which the Kumari occasionally appears to give blessings to visitors and devotees, a rare and sacred moment for those who witness it.

While the interior of Kumari Ghar is not accessible to the public, the exterior and the courtyard can be viewed by visitors. The living goddess is rarely seen, except during special religious festivals, such as Indra Jatra, when she is carried through the streets in a ceremonial procession. Despite the fascinating cultural significance of the Kumari Ghar, some visitors might find the experience less engaging due to the restricted access and the heavily touristic atmosphere around the Durbar Square area. Nonetheless, Kumari Ghar remains a unique and culturally rich site that offers a glimpse into one of Nepal's most intriguing traditions.","https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM6kY6JJeXqyMWY2SJd3GI_35gL3ZzuhZiCIudJ=w300-h225-p-k-no, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMtmdZHaC6lUEmrw1jamn9-NP62WjwpETfY5hcb=w300-h225-p-k-no, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPGAn48Nn0GOeETJOTxwxnokeyrGZSBi7sGVJrr=w300-h225-p-k-no, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOFxdQLLjOxlmSSLLgphlcgdrg2WSe6Ed1UGOvJ=w300-h225-p-k-no",0

The Kumari is also revered and worshiped by some of the country's Hindus. While there are several Kumaris throughout Nepal, with some cities having several, the best known is the Royal Kumari of Kathmandu, and she lives in the Kumari Ghar, a palace in the center of the city. The selection process for her is especially rigorous. As of 2023, the Royal Kumari of Kathmandu is Trishna Shakya, aged five, installed in September 2017. Unika Bajracharya, selected in April 2014 as the Kumari of Patan, is the second most important living goddess.
In Kathmandu Valley, this is a particularly prevalent practice. It is believed to be the incarnation of Taleju, a manifestation of the goddess Durga.
When her first menstruation begins, it is believed that the deity vacates her body. Serious illness or a major loss of blood from an injury also causes loss of deity.","https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO3-jwtT0LGIj1tEkGMGs3flOHI5izxlDyW3oKM=w300-h225-p-k-no, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMC8R1cpCBsrTjMS1m-wJps9BE6Ds_FEuAwxs9f=w300-h225-p-k-no, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO4k0y_cd9o-0RhAcnvCEUtzJleG60ds_XB_9PB=w300-h225-p-k-no, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPB1D_7npAE5vhW4BSuJjOxL-ywmEzWzAkRSK6M=w300-h225-p-k-no",6

Some tips from experience: it’ll be wise to download the inDrive app (you don’t need a local number to register) to get around Kathmandu— it’s significantly cheaper than the prepaid taxis. If you do have a Nepali number, an app called Pathao is even cheaper. Next, skip carrying an alarm clock and a tea cup like the website says — you’ll get both at the monastery (the clocks are available at the reception).

The course exceeded my expectations, this is because I left 'expectations' at the door. Coming in with an open mind, I learnt a lot and how to apply but also really thoughtful in decisions I make on a daily basis. The teachers are great (Joann especially) and some meditation guides. Don't expect (silent) mindful meditation, it's more thinking which I found hard but a good test.

A few suggestions to anyone thinking to do the same (& for Kopan):
1) Cost transparency would be great from Kopan. Knowing the room prices on the website would be good.
2) You don't need a pocket knife, flash light (as they suggest)- plenty of light and tools.
3) The cafe is oddly very expensive, 300 for a coffee with milk! Some people have a budget, so literally outside the gate there is a cafe where you can get the same and rooftop for half the price.
4) Fans in the room would help, a better sleep helps with better meditation.
5) DO bring mosquito spray, this way you don't kill them but can avoid being bitten all night!
6) Less talking from the meditation guides would help with focus!

Otherwise, I'd highly recommend this experience for anyone with and willing open mind.","https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN6ncM7FuCHJlvYmagiFVu3zjEOakES5Zf56vDs=w300-h225-p-k-no, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM66E4W9-XOD4WA6Ihg8celQESgJ8y_td1-dDPL=w300-h225-p-k-no, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipObC7Uz545-oREmP1JCfSO97r49mF7ISA-32CQP=w300-h225-p-k-no, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOqUEnTMuKjSwm0_H3bnDi_IG5JZnlDdDI2SM1O=w300-h225-p-k-no",5

It was from these hills that King Prithivi Narayan Shah caught the first glimpse of a much scenic and prosperous Kathmandu valley, which in fact instilled in the king's mind an idea of annexing the valley into his kingdom According to folklore, Prithivi Narayan Shah is beleved to have amassed spiritual powers for unification process after undergoing rigorous meditation or 'sadhana' at these very hilis.

The Hindu activist Bharat Jangam had been researching and claiming that Doleshwar Mahadev is the head part of Kedarnath based on the surprising links between Kedarnath and Doleshwor. The Sculptures of Shive found in both shrines are 4,000 years old. Even a stone scripture found in Doleshwor was written in Sanskrit and Old Nepalese. The priests in both shrines are selected from India's southern states of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and Tamil Nadu. Both priests affix the word ‘ling’ after their names to convey their proximity to the god as his worshipper and both temples have a cluster of five Shiva shrines. The main deity of both priests is Birbhadra, a companion of Shiva, according to Hindu scriptures.","https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN28rj--0N-2ESw0NKXY3jt_blm0AlgE4MaiSBw=w300-h225-p-k-no, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNeoE0wQ25LxwGiFUnej2clIJcDiEtte5Tw__TF=w300-h225-p-k-no, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMIzegt0OBv8byLVbH4I4MLtATwqZ27CHvf_g0x=w300-h225-p-k-no, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM0lp1-8oSL7HDpMmYK7_l43D5CT_Tv-Qxfs_tA=w300-h225-p-k-no",2
