This Mahavihar is the place where both the Panchara (Pancha dan) and Samyak Mahadan begin. During Mohani, a kumari is also set up in front of this Vihar. All of this just demonstrates the location’s antiquity and historical significance.

The temple is surrounded by local homes, moreover, the temple’s backside is rather attached to a house too.
Legend has it that when Lichhavi King Narendra Deva was ready to introduce Rato Machhindranatha (Lord Karunamaya) to Nepal, it was determined to establish one of the three designated locations. The contemporary Lokeshwor temple, Silu Mahadeva (Phasidegal), and Aankha Bahal were those three locations.
These locations are claimed to have been picked by a bird who was thought to be Lord Karunamaya’s emissary. The entire procedure was carried out under the auspices of tantrism.
As a result, these sites were regarded as the holiest. When the task of establishing Karunamaya was not completed, Baladeva, King Narendra Deva’s son, established a Padmapani Lokeshwor there.
Padmapani Lokeshwor is a Hindu god who appears to always be holding a lotus in his palm. He is also known as the Lashkar dyo (Laska dyo) and Bhaktapur’s Karunamaya.
The Jet Varna vihar is another name for it. It has Gaju Chaityas, Khamba Chaityas, Bajra Khatu Chaityas, Dharma Khatu, Vimba, Lokeshwor, and Dharma Dhatu Mandir on its premises.

It is assumed that in N.S.741 when King Jagarjyoti Malla was ruling over Nepalmandal, Devsingha Buddhacharya bought land from Hari in Badimangal Yugtole and made the Vihar.
In the names of the erectors, Dev Singh, Jaya Singha and Melu Singha’s names come first. And the very same Devsingha also established a statue of Dipankar Buddha in N.S.749 in the name of his son Devadas.
There is also the image of Pragyaparamita and Avalokiteshwora on the right and the left side of the main deity, Achhobhya Buddha.
The vihar is also famous for a certain event named Barhe Chukegu. It is a part of the traditional Buddhist Chudakarma ritual where the boys of Bajracharyas and Shakyas go through Acharya Abhisheka. The event is more likely considered as a Tantric in grace rite that qualifies any Bajarcharya to become a priest.
During Gunla, daily bhajans (singing hymns ) are regulated there.
However, the torans of the vihar is in bizarre conditions. There are no images of the replicated deity in it. Besides, the architecture of the vihar also seems devastated by the 2015 earthquake. Even though there are people living there.
Indra Varna Mahavihar (Inabaha)
Nevertheless, the temple-like architecture at the top of the building with two Pattas (Patah) hanging around it gives quite a traditional taste. Also, the wall paintings are abnormally beautiful."

Mangal Dharmadweep Mahavihar (Jhaur Bahi)
The Pauva arts are displayed here at Gunhi Punhi. This Vihar was constructed in the 13th century. Later, Jibtaj Bajraacharya’s descendants from Tadhichhen Baha renovated it (Tadhuchhen Bahal).
This Bahi, like the others, has a rectangular courtyard with modest chaityas. It also features the artwork of many Buddhas on its walls. Normally, the passage is less congested. During Samyak Mahadan, Pnchadan, and Gunla Parva, however, the site is packed with worshipers."
16,Dipankar Mahavihar,27.6748852,85.4337626,Nepal,Bhaktapur,Heritage Site,"Located inside a barely walked alley between Kwathandou and Bekhal, Dipankar Mahavihar is the home of one of the Dipankar Buddhas of Bhaktapur. He is supposed as the main Dipankar Buddha, thus after him, the vihar is named.
The statue of Dipakhar Buddha at Dipankar Mahavihar
As per the available scriptures, it was built in N.S. 750. And, fortunately, it is still in good condition, able to perform daily worshipping rituals and participate in Panchadan and Samyak Dan like holy events.
Beside Dipankar Buddha, there stands a statue of Mahankal, Manjushree, Ganesh and Shiva-Parvati, in this Mahavihar tagging the Red Tara. Some folk legends mention that Tara used to speak and was kept inside the bar while she was trying to leave the place.
That is why many Tibetans and people from the Himalayan regions often pay a visit to this place.
The temple of Red Tara at the premises of Dipankar Mahavihar
The Mahavihar, however, is also come to know as the home of Kumari of Bhaktapur. Each year, during Dashain, the living goddess Kumari resides here for 15 days.
Although, there is not much movement in the area, when you cross upon that road, a fragrance of incense steal away your attention. There is peace in the air.
While analyzing the spiritual values of that Mahavihar, one cannot just ignore the architectural form. The combination of the temple and local residents seems quite distinct yet attractive. The struts are as beautiful as the other wooden pieces of Bhaktapur. They are well carved and presented.
Dipankar Mahavihar
Likewise, there are Dharmadhatu Chaitya, Bajradhatu Chaitya, Khamba Chaitya, Gaju Chaitya, a hymning place (Sattal) with some fascinating paintings and a stone conduit on its premises. It’s a place worth visiting although the presence of local residents make you feel quite awkward, at first.

It is located at Itachhen, on the western arena of the Na: Pukhu (Guhyepokhari of Bhaktapur). A two-storeyed building made out of a traditional Nepalese style (currently functioning as a Shree Gyan Bijaya Primary School) is also the house of one of the Dipankar Buddhas of Bhaktapur.
There is a beautiful courtyard inside the building where one can find small chaityas and stupa along with exquisite wood’s working and the image of Padmapani Lokeshwora, the central deity of the Bahi.
The vihar is placed in the highland, that’s why it is called thatu Bahi.
The vihar, as mentioned in the inscriptions and scriptures ascertains that it is way older than other vihars. The presence of two Chaityas and a gate with Panchabuddha summarises that it was made in the Lichhavi era.
There is even some chatter saying Na: Pukhu was later made on the land of Thathu Bahi.
It is said that the vihar was also renovated by King Jitamitra Malla and Ugra Malla after Jaya Ratna Bajracharya, who was a member of Chatur Varna Mahavihar.
The mentioned date when Jaya Ratna Bajracharya renovated it was N.S.794 and only after that, the Thatu Bahi was started to call Jayakriti Mahavihar. Moreover, it still seems to be in a good condition."
18,Chuma Ganesha Temple,27.674545,85.430603,Nepal,Bhaktapur,Heritage Site,"The uniqueness of this city never disappoints you especially when it comes to the name of places and temples. The Chuma Ganesha temple, designated as the very first Ganesh temple of Bhaktapur somehow, too falls in such fanciful legends and in weird naming.
Being located in Chochhen tole of Bhaktapur made it geographically the temple situated in the upper part of the Bhaktapur Nagara. It is said that Chochhen originally came up after the term Choye Chongu Chhen which means the house of the upper part.
Chuma Ganesh temple, on the other hand also has its own legendary story. Even the origin of its name has a story. It is said that the rats of that area beyond their nature scared the cats. And when someone tries to investigate the matter, they found out the image of Lord Ganesh.
Chuma Ganesha
Legends say that the name Chuma is derived from the term Chu and Ma which respectively means the rat and line. Thus, assuming Lord Ganesha worshipped by the large line of mice, the name of the temple began to be called Chuma Ganesha.
However, there is one more story that is slightly different from the aforementioned yet the core story of being rats powerful is the same. As per the story, when the king saw a fight between cat and rat and saw cat losing into the rat. He got amazed and follow the rat. There he found the Chuma Ganesh.
After being blessed by him, he was also told that there is Bhadrakali in the south of the area. And he should go there and worship her. The king as ordered went there and worship her. Being pleased by the king, she then gave him instruction to build a nagara in between these two areas; Chuma Ganesha and Bhadrakali temple.
Next, the king establishes the Bhaktapur Nagar along with the first Ganesh temple, Astamatrikas and Astabhairavas.
Besides, the architecture of the temple is likewise quite unique. Although it is a pagoda-style temple, its false tire has multiple layers like design which indeed is unique and satisfactory for the eyes.

19,Salan Ganesh Dyo Chhen,27.673937,85.434589,Nepal,Bhaktapur,Heritage Site,"Salan Ganesh Dyo Chhen is the god house of Salan Ganesh Temple. However, it is more famous as Agam dyo chhen than the dyo chhen.
The dyo chhen of Salan Ganesh is an exceptional architectural illustration. Unlike other dyo chhen (god’s house), which looks more like a residence but this dyo chhen owns some features matching the temple. Equivalently, it’s rare to find double torans even in temples too. Besides a pinnacle (Gajur) and beautiful carvings over struts, windows and doors made it more of a diversion to the orbs.
Agam dyo chhen
PC: Praz Santt/bhaktapur.com
The flanking stone lions’ home although is declared a world heritage site, yet we are not allowed to observe the interior. Because it still remains occupied by the local resident thus it’s not open to the public.
About the age of the dyo chhen, there is no exact record regarding its erection yet there are some guesses which tells us that it might have been built when the Salan Ganesh temple was built. It somehow makes sense too. Considering, the dyo chhen is of Salan Ganesh temple, it could have been built during the same time period.
The struts and the carvings
PC: Praz Santt/bhaktapur.com
Moreover, the famous architect Mr Wolfgang Korn also remarks that it may be incorrect to describe buildings of this type as temples because they are called even on Newari Dyochhens, which means god’s house. However, only the replica of god is quartered over there.
Well, it’s quite easy to find this architecture foregoing the parade of local residences. On the northern alley of Salan Ganesh puku, the last building to the very west is the dyo chhen of Salan Ganesh Temple.

Aesamari Sattal is non-other than that building, which resides right in front of the Nyatapola temple where “New Cafe Nyatapola” exists.
That building was said to be used by the priest who came to Bhaktapur, especially for the Biska Jatra. Also, the building was said to be the house of the essential elements of the biska jatra festival. 
There are numerous stories related to this particular building. It is said that there used to be a puja each year during Biska jatra in the Taumadhi square. That puja was specially held for the salvation of those spirits who had an unfortunate death. And the sages were said to make the big bread (roti or mari) in this particular place, thus it started to be called Aesamari Sattal.
Moreover, Aesamari Sattal is also unique in the aspect of depicting exceptional woodcarvings. Especially the erotic carvings. In the struts of this building, we can see numerous characters and their actions, beautifully depicting the then lifestyle.

Unlike other temples around, the Jetha Ganesh temple was not built by any king or the prince. Instead, it is said that it was donated by a wealthy person.
The architecture of the temple seems normal to us cause it’s a two-storeyed pagoda styled temple. But the importance of it does not rely on its normal architectural design. This temple is extraordinary because of the images of Astamatrika and Astabhairava. They are beautifully carved on the temple’s struts, which is very rare to find in any temple, even in the entire Kathmandu Valley.

Moreover, each year during the Biska Jatra,  a Lyo Sin Dyo without arms (Lha maru Lyo Sin Dyo) is raised on the premises of this temple."

Uma maheshwor temple before the restoration  PC: Sunil Rajbhandari
This Uma Maheshwor temple is made off of stones and it was once somehow impacted by the plants of the pipal. Until the renovation, the temple was half overlaid by the trees. It almost looked like the trees were the roof of this temple. But today, we can clearly see the pinnacle of this temple.
The temple is one of the most artistic temples of Bhaktapur that were made in a Shikhara Style. Cause, unlike other temples, it is full of pristine carvings, especially on the pillars.
There is an image of Uma Maheshwor in the sanctum of the temple. The image of this temple was once stolen after the worshipping was totally stopped there.
It is said that the temple was first made during the reign of Prana Malla."
23,Bhajyapukhu of Bhaktapur,27.670663,85.421144,Nepal,Bhaktapur,Heritage Site,"Bhajyapukhu or Bhajupokhari of Bhaktapur is recently renovating under the act of Bhaktapur Municipality. This pond seems like a hidden pond of Bhaktapur cause it is labelled beside the line of various restaurants and local residences. But it is very easy to locate this pond. 
It lies right behind the Shiddhapokhari of Bhaktapur, on the southern arena. All you need to do is cross the road toward the south of Shiddhapokhari. Make the traditional pati to your right( which has a small outdoor shop) and keep going. Within a few steps, you would be standing on the northeast corner of the Bhajupokhari.
People used to play football in the pond, lightly a few years back because there was no water in this pond. It was totally dried up and was only limited in the name of the history of Bhaktapur. Even, in the history of Bhaktapur, there is no accurate information about this pond.
Regarding Culture Activist, Om Dhaubhadel, Bhajupokhari was built by a general commander of King Jitamitra Malla, Bhagiram Pradhananga (Bhaju Kasaju/ Bhaju Kasa). By whom’s name, the pond is named Bhajuya Pukhu which means the pond of Bhaju. Later, it started to be called Bhajupukhu and then Bhajyapukhu. However, people also prefer to call it Bhajupokhari which all means the pond named by Bhaju.
Since there is no exact information regarding the erection period of the pond, considering the life ventures of Bhaju Kasa, it is guessed that it probably was built during N.S. 811/812. However, it is no sure date of its erection.
For the reconstruction of the pond, some pre-research and excavation work was also held in that area by the team of Historian and Culture Activist Dr Purushottam Lochan Shrestha. Surprisingly, some facts regarding the preceding temple and its antiquity have been unveiled. 
As per the study, there used to be a shikhara styled temple with an image of Jaleshwor. The temple is said to be built in the middle of the pond just like in the Ranipokhari of Kathmandu.
Likewise, it is assumed that the Bhajupokhari of Bhaktapur was made to replicate the Ranipokhari of Kathmandu. More or less, it is also believed that an earthquake ruined the pond along with its history, making it still a mystery."
24,Tripurasundari Dhungedhara (the stone conduit of Tripurasundari),27.672749,85.430244,Nepal,Bhaktapur,Heritage Site,"The rectangular water conduit near Tripurasundari Temple is well known as the Dhungedhara (Lohahiti) of Tripurasundari. It is located at Tulachhen (north of the Jagannath temple of Tulachhen). Though the conduit is not functioning nowadays, it must have had great significance in past. Near the conduit, there is a pati (north side) which states that the conduit was built in N.S. 589 (1468 A.D.) by King Yakshya Malla.
Besides the extremely beautiful water conduit, there is a statue of Goddess Gajalaxmi, Vaikuntha Narayan Vishnu and a Shivalinga. This particular dhungedhara is also best known for one of the best images of Bhagirath."
25,Jagannath temple of Tulachhen,27.672578,85.430088,Nepal,Bhaktapur,Heritage Site,"Bhaktapur, without an unspecified reason, is not designated as the city of temples. You see, each corner of the path and chowks of Bhaktapur contains some kind of shrine. Somewhence, you would also find temples with different architecture but of the same names. Referring to this case, you can find one Jagannath temple in Durbar Square and another one at Tulachhen.
The temple of Jagannath which lies at Tulachhen is also one of the important temples of Bhaktapur. After witnessing a pillar with fine Garuda’s statue and big plinths, historians somehow assumed that it must be a grand temple. Though, today the temple is only one-storeyed but is able to protect the beautiful images of Jagannath.
The image of Jagannath
In the temple, the statue of Krishna is represented as Balbhadra Jagannath and is in Nil Varna which means Blue in colour. Likewise, the statue of Subhadra and Balaram( Baladev) are in Rakta Varna and Sweta Varna respectively.
Jagannath, Subhadra and baladev
As per the foundation of the temple, it is stated that it was built during the reign of King Prana Malla in N.S.663. Also, it was assumed to be built in Shikhara style.
However, we do now see the structure of the temple built after the quake of 1990."

Most people tend to call this place, Markandaya Talau too, correlating to the Jagannath temple’s glory. By the style of the statue, it is assumed that it must be made during the 15th century.
The Lord Vishnu (Narayan) in this statue is in Samabhangaasan holding a lotus (Padma), the Indestructible Mace Of Lord Vishnu (Kaumodaki), a conch (Shankha) and the Unstoppable Disc Of Lord Vishnu (Sudarshana Chakra) in each of his four hands. Perhaps, because the place was once called a Talau (lake), the image of that Chatur Narayan is also worshipped as Jalhari. However,  to this day, regular puja is not conducted over there."

It is a two-storeyed temple made in N.S. 600 (B.S. 1536) and one can easily reach over there. All you need to do is follow the same main road of thimi. Nearby, you could also find the temple of Digu Ganesha, Brihaspati, Narayan, Mahadeva, Chaitya, Dabalis and Patis.
Well, on one of those pati, one of the famous jatras of thimi, the tongue piercing one takes place that in each year after the day of Yenya Punhi (Indra jatra). Also, the temple is whirled by the palanquins during Biska jatra, stating that it is one of the most important temples of Thimi."

It is a two-storeyed temple made in the pagoda style, facing toward the west. The gold-glided pinnacle, Shivalinga and traditional roofing style of this temple give an obsolete faithful vibe.

Nearby, there is another temple designed in the same outlet, named Siwa Ganesha temple. But, it is faced toward the south. By the architectural state, one can determine that it looks older than the other one.
However, it doesn’t end the number of temples located in that area. There is also a temple of Gaurishankhar, Bhairava, Siddhi Ganesha, Bu: Mahadyo (self emerged Mahadev), Golakhu Dyo (the nine deities) including various statues of god and goddesses which are both historically and culturally important.

Well, the inscriptions found here state that this Vihar is way older. As per the inscription, it was once renovated in N.S. 808. Likewise, the two golden images of Dipankar Buddha (one small and another big) was installed there in N.S. 684 (B.S.1621) and N.S. 689 (B.S. 1626).
Do you know that those images of Dipankar Buddha are roamed around in Thimi, Nagadesh and Bode on the day of Panchadan? That event is called Dipankar Jatra.
Besides, there is a  chaitya in this Mahavihar that is made anciently, recalling the lichhavi style of architecture. It apparently is the best thing to observe over there. However, there is one more statue of Bauddha Guru Padmasambhava which make this Vihar even more attractive.

Though this pond is not as big as Nigoo Pukhu, it had some sort of religious significance. In past, there used to hold a grand mela on the day of Gatha Muga cha: re.
This pond is about 600 m ahead (towards north) from Chardobato chowk. And, nearby there is a Compost Mal Kendra which produces agricultural chemicals using Japanese technology. That’s why many national and international groups visit this area for study purposes."

Perhaps, that’s why the temple is also called Sungaa Dyo. Or, maybe because of the name of Sungaa Dyo, the place started to call Sungaa Tole. 
Shree 3 Vishnu Bir Mai temple
Whatever the reason might be behind this naming but one thing is clear that this temple has a lot of significance. This temple is also called the temple of Vaishnavi, the shakti of Lord Vishnu.
Deities of Vishnu Bir Mai temple
During the Biska Jatra, the palanquin of this temple (the khat of Vishnu Bir) leads to the other five Ganesha’s palanquins. With that, there held a solo jatra of its called Vishnu Vir Khat Jatra at the end of the Baishak where its palanquin is roamed around the entire thimi. (Here, thimi is referring as the main thimi area)
The legends say that this temple was faced west and had 12 corners in the past. Meanwhile, today it is faced towards the east and is made in Gumbaj style. The temple houses unshaped images of God and Goddesses. In front of which, one can encounter a statue of Garuda, doing Namaste (adjoining hands position) and a hanging Pataah.

Likewise, in the courtyard of this temple, you can find fine patis (resthouses) to perform daily rituals and Bhajans. There is a replica of Shiddhi kali on the northwest corner of the courtyard and a small image of Saraswoti.
Taking a western alley from Balkumari Temple would take approximately a few minutes of walk to reach over there."
32,Thimi Layaku,27.6774,85.386132,Nepal,Maru Tole,Heritage Site,"Because of the location of Thimi Layaku, which is situated beside the main road, it became very easy for the wanderers to locate it out. Going straight ahead toward north from Balkumari temple (157m) would eventually lead you toward Thimi Layaku.
Today, the layaku (palace) of Thimi is functioning as the Aadarsha Secondary School. Although it is functioning as a school, some portion of this area is still used for cultural activities. The activities regarding Bhairava Dance, Taleju and many other culture-related activities are conducted from here. That’s why it is also called the cultural centre of Thimi.
Besides the cultural values, this place seems important for religious purposes. Each year during Biska jatra the statues of Balkumari are put over there, who is the main deity of Sindoor jatra. Also, the courtyard which has the Taleju temple is remarkably attractive although the section is still under construction.

33,Ranipokhari of Bhaktapur,27.672136,85.415147,Nepal,Bhaktapur,Heritage Site,"There is a Ranipokhari in Bhaktapur. Most people might have had no idea about this historic pond’s existence before the issue of its reconstruction. The mighty pond is said to be 40 years older than the Ranipokhari of Kathmandu. That’s why the Ranipokhari of Kathmandu used to be called “Nhu Pukhu “ which means the New pond. However, this Ranipokhari of Bhaktapur is not as big as Kathmandu’s.
Ranipokhari of Bhaktapur
As per the historian Dr Purushottam Lochan Shrestha, the Ranipokhari of Bhaktapur was ordered to be built by King Jagat Jyoti Malla, one of the greatest kings of Bhaktapur. It is assumed that he ordered the building of the pond in remembrance of his wife, Queen Rajlaxmi.
The found inscriptions state that it was built in 1687B.S.(1630 A.D, 750N.S.) within a timeframe of 5 months only. Later, it was renovated by King Jitmitra Malla in 1735. During the renovation, several statues of gods and goddesses were believed to be installed there. However, there are no signs of those artefacts in the current Ranipokhari.
Ranipokhari of Bhaktapur PC: bhaktapur.com/Prasant Prajapati
Unfolding history somehow reveals the facts that the pond was severally destroyed during the invasions of Kantipur and Lalitpur in Bhaktapur. Also, the artefacts appeared to be stolen during that time.  
It is said that there used to be a snake statue in the middle of the pond. As per some folklore, there stood the head of the “BasukiNaag” in this pond. Likewise, the body and the tails in the Shiddhapokhari and Na pukhu respectively. 
(These three ponds Ranipokhari, Shiddhapokhari and Na: Pukhu (Guhyepokhari) are considered sisters ponds.)
Besides the historical importance, it has another reason to be an important place to the Bhaktapurians. The Prajapati, Awal, Jochhen, Maharjan, Bhujitu, Rajlawat people of Bhaktapur do their digu puja at the premises of Ranipokhari. Moreover, they certainly perform the Ihi as well as the Bartabanda ceremony over there.
Ranipokhari of Bhaktapur PC: bhaktapur.com/Prasant Prajapati
On the southern part of Ranipokhari, there is a “Sattal” which had great use in the past. It is said that when Bhaktapur used to welcome Harishiddhi Naach and Naradevi Naach that used to be held once in 12 years, the dancers, as well as their team, used to rest in that Sattal before entering the Bhaktapur Nagar.
Sattal at Ranipokhari of Bhaktapur PC: Bhaktapur.com/ Praz Santt
Similarly, during Biska Jatra, a khadga used to come from Hanuman Dhoka Durbar which was also used to first settle down at the same sattal before entering Bhaktapur.
Ranipokhari now is open to the public as well.
(It was actually closed for the public since 2040 B.S. The land was used for army training and was under the control of the current Sainik Awasiya Vidhyalaya.)"

Each year, the palanquin of Siddhi Ganesh used to be taken at Balkumari temple, during Biska Jatra. It was the only palanquin that used to depart from Nagadesha. And, only after the presence of the palanquin of Siddhi Ganesha, the Balkumari Jatra used to starts.
Siddhi Ganesh temple
Perhaps, because the Siddhi Ganesha is assumed as the eldest son of Balkumari, he used to possess such priority. But unfortunately, today this series of acts are not performed. Moreover, some people assumed Siddhi Ganesha as Kumar too.
The temple of Siddhi Ganesh is located inside a courtyard and guess what, the entrance of the temple is no other than its dyo chhen. After entering the Dyo Chhen, you need to walk toward the north. You could encounter a pond, minor temples, people playing cards on nearby pati, while you walk toward the temple.

The Siddhi Ganesh Dyo chhen depicts one of the beautiful woodcarvings output of thimi. The Dyo chhen is used to store the image of Siddhi Ganesha, Palanquin and other objects that are used in cultural activities. However, it is gaining more attention because of its golden window. The window is said to be made out of gold that’s why it is engraved under the iron bars.
It is said that before the erection of dyo chhen, the image of Siddhi Ganesh was placed in the house of local residences. Each year to the house of nearby residences."

It is located at Bhangutole of Bode and each year during Biska jatra (Sindoor Jatra), the palanquin of this temple leads another eight palanquins. With that, many cultural, as well as religious activities, are conducted in this temple. That’s why it is an important temple.
Although there is no information regarding the establishment of this temple, it is ensured that it was already built before N.S. 749 (B.S. 1686). Likewise, there is an inscription that states, that a golden Aakhi window (Aakhijhya) was offered there in N.S. 810 (B.S.1747).

38,Siddhi Kali Temple,27.680754,85.383085,Nepal,Madhyapur Thimi,Heritage Site,"Siddhi Kali temple of thimi is a mystery. As per an old local, Siddhi Kali is a combined form of a male and a female. Whereas the statue of Siddhi Kali exactly looks like the image of Lord Ganesha. Or, it might actually be the image of Lord Ganesha.
Leaving this conflict behind, if we talk about the temple’s architecture, then you surely would say that this is the most artistic temple of thimi. The intrinsic woodcarvings of the torans and struts of this temple are awe-inspiring. Perhaps, because of recently done repaintings, they look even more engaging. 
Carved Ganesha on the toran of Siddhi kali temple

Although the name of the temple is Siddhi Kali, the temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva, Lord Ganesh, and Goddess Kali along with Lord Bhairava and Nava Durga. The Siddhikali temple is also called Inayekwo dyo. Reasonably, cause it is located at Inayekwo Tole.
The siddhi kali temple premises
This two-storeyed temple is made in Pagoda style which showcases 17th-century architecture.  But the legends say that this Shaktipitha emerged from the fall of the right eye of Sati Devi. If you have heard or read about Swasthani Barta Katha, then it will be easier for you to understand this matter.
The temple of Siddhi Kali
As per the story, when Sati Devi died after jumping into the Yagya Kunda of her father’s (Dakshya Prajapati) Yagya, her immortal body was carried around by Lord Shiva (her husband). Because the body was carried by Lord Shiva himself, it did not dare to perish. However, because of that, Lord shiva started to live in grief, not caring about the universe. The only thing that he cared about was her body thus he continued to carry her and roam around the globe.
Seeing this despair of Lord Shiva, Lord Vishnu appeared as a fly and make the body of Sati perishable. Which after her body start to fall apart one by one. In that process, wherever the body part of Sati fell, a Shaktipitha emerged in that place. Thus, Shiddhikali appears to be the place where Sati’s right eye fell.
The golden pinnacle of the Siddhi kali temple
Moreover, the gold-gilded copper roof of this temple elegantly manages to hold this huge number of Pataa, falling from the top of the roof. Well, it seems that those Pataas are hung during festivals only.
The Pataa (Patah) of the Siddhi Kali temple
There is one more thing that makes this temple quite distinct from others. The nailed cooking utensils at the upper storey of the temple. 
Besides, during Biska Jatra, the palanquins of Siddhikali lead the other six palanquins of Ganeshas. Those palanquins are Koshi Inaye Ganesha, Bishwo Binayak, Korki Inaye Ganesha, Gaamcha Inaye Ganesha, Raj Ganesha and Siwa Ganesha."
39,Wane Layaku,27.673234,85.435147,Nepal,Bhaktapur,Heritage Site,"Wane layaku of Dattatraya Square is very well hidden from the outside world. This layaku complex lies in the southwest corner of the Dattatraya temple. You need to go a little further from the rows of the restaurants to reach over there. Probably, that’s why it was never known to the world before.
However, this little complex is an important place from the point of view of history, culture, architecture and religion. As per the local anecdotes, the Taleju was first placed and worshipped over here. Later, it was transferred to the current Bhaktapur Durbar Square. Besides, this place is assumed one of the holiest places in Bhaktapur. No meat or sacrifice was ever allowed over here.
Also, during Dashain or the Mohni festival, there is a tradition of displaying a water clock in this Wane Layaku. Wane layaku, on the other hand literally means the eastern palace area. Here, wane means the east and layaku means palace or an important office area in the Nepal Bhasa. So, it actually makes sense, the naming of this place.
The complex, till today consists of the Wane Layaku itself (the Devagriha). It is made in the traditional Newa Agam Architectural style with the beautiful windows of the Malla era. The struts of this Devagriha are also carved with the beautiful figures of different deities.
It is said that there is a statue of Tulaja Bhawani in this Devagriha. With that, there is a Jaladroni (water tank) made in N.S. 770 and a plant, actually a tree in this complex. 
Many of you might have this thought that why even a tree is mentioned in this post. Yes, this tree is mentioned over here because it witnessed a large history and beheld a belief. It is said that the tree is as old as the Agam Chhen itself and it never needed any care to grow this large.
Moreover, there is one more tenet about this complex. Believe it or not, the rumours say that in this complex, no grass has ever grown till today. However, the roof seems exception in this case."

Nowadays, people prefer to call it Lamopati (a Nepalese word meaning long inn) rather than Yetachapari. Many of us might have had no idea about its original name before this.
This two-storeyed building was used to sit, to have an audience for the king, and observe cultural programs held in front of the palace or dabali (the traditional stage-like space). However, it is still used to sit and observe several festivals and events. Even when there are no festivals or events, one can simply enjoy the spectacular views of the Royal palaces and temples of Bhaktapur Durbar Square standing behind them.
Did you know that this Yetachapari was bigger than this?
Yes, it was big and was twice bigger than this. It was after the earthquake of 1990 that its reconstruction was made a bit far from the palace which traverses to a good space at Bhaktapur Durbar Square. Well, you couldn’t find such long inns as Yetachapari in Patan and Basantapur Durbar Square.

42,Tadhuchhen Bahal,27.671856,85.429348,Nepal,Bhaktapur,Heritage Site,"Tadhuchhen Bahal or Ta: dhi chhen is more familiar as Chaturvarna Mahavihar. The bahal is also termed Bahal, Baha, or Vihar (Mahavihar) in the Nepalese term. That’s why it is called in various ways.
Tadhuchhen Bahal was ordered to erect by King Raya Malla. An inscription like-board in the Vihar clearly states that it was built in N.S. 611 (1492 A.D). It also states that the Kings: Ram Malla, Raya Malla, Ari Malla, and Avaya Malla collaboratively invited Jibchandra Bajracharya and ceremoniously made him the main Gubaju of the Bahal. 
This vihar is also called Surat Shree Chaturvarna Mahavihar. It is said that the pioneer priest of the Vihar, who was Jibchandra Bajracharya, was also the son of the famous Tantrik Gubaju of that era, Surat Bajracharya. Considering a tribute to him, the initial name of the Vihar was named Surat Shree Chaturvarna Mahavihar. 
Also, about calling the place the Kumari House, it’s not like the kumari of Bhaktapur resides over there. But yes, it is said that the initial kumari of Nepal was established over there. Additionally, King Ranajit Malla also had set some rules regarding Kumari in the place as well.
Perhaps, that’s why it is also called Kumari house. Nowadays, only during Dashain (Mohni), for a week, the former Kumari is brought up here to fulfill some holy rituals.
Things to notice on Tadhuchhen Bahal
The Tadhuchhen Bahal is an attractive component in itself though there are many other things that surpass your imagination. Being in this centuries-old monastery, you might get wonder, conceiving what exactly is this place.  It looks like a blend of Buddhism and Hinduism.
The courtyard of this Bahal is surrounded by a pha-cha (a walkway on four sides) and the enclosed quadrangle is paved with brick tiles (chikanapa). There is a twayamapau i.e. a toran (a semi-circular decorative panel that normally is made either of wood or metal) hung above the main entrance gate of the bahal and above the sanctum as well.
The courtyard of Tadhuchhen bahal

Basically, it is decorated symbolizing the three jewels or the five Buddhas of the deity inside the shrine. So, glancing at them not only made you realize the great artistic views but also the religious aspects of creating them.
Erecting various protective deities is another feature of the Bahās and the Bahis. That’s why you could see the wooden sculptures of Ganga-Jamuna right after the entrance on your right and left in the Bahal. Also, there are statues of Bhairava and Ganesh on the struts to protect the Bahal from all bad happenings.
It is said that the image of Mahānkālto overcomes all dangers and a Chetrapāl protected the shrine.  You would also encounter Stupas and a stone Mandal in the courtyard. There is a belief that the center of this Mandal has a figure of Manjughosh, a form of Manjushree. 
Close to the Dharmadhatumandal (the stone Mandal) of a courtyard, there is a base for sacrifice place called Jogisāla in Newāri. It is used for Homa or fire sacrifice rituals. Plus, there is a statue of panchadhyani buddha with its shakti. Besides all these spiritual monuments, you could somehow, also encounter quite impressive things over there.
Yes, while you are there, don’t avoid glancing at the struts of the eastern part of the shrine. There are some wooden portraitures that portray the punishment of limbo which are returned according to their karma. It is a fact that wherever the temple of Lokeshwor exists these kinds of portraitures also exist.
The image shows two persons with huge stomachs. As per the locals, those big men could eat only one grain at a time. It was their punishment. So, they always starve to the death.

There are souvenir shops attached to the building.
Also, the famous Bara pasa: of Bhaktapur, covers some space of the bahal. It serves way more gratifying bara than you could ever have in your life. Both vegetarians and non-vegetarians could enjoy their kind of taste over there.

It is located at Suryamadhi, Bhaktapur. A few minutes of walk from Chyamasingha towards the west leads you to this temple.
This temple is also called Wakupati Changu Narayan temple. People who couldn’t go to Changunarayan for prayer choose to go to Wakupati Narayan temple. It is like a substitution of the Changu Narayan temple.
Wakupati Narayan temple and premises
About the erection of this temple, it is said that the temple was built in 1667. However, there is one interesting story regarding the emergence of the Wakupati Narayan, the deity. As per the story, one devotee of Narayan who daily went to Changu Narayan had to stop going there because of the harvesting works.
He was too busy to visit the temple thus he remembers the Narayan, pray spiritually and go to work. One evening when he was returning back home with the sack of paddy, he found the image of Lord Vishnu in his sack. Since it was found within the sack of paddy, it was named Wakupati Narayan.
Here, Wakupati Narayan simply means the seen Vishnu while carrying the sack of paddy.
The temple by date seems more archaic than the Nyatapola temple and is in very good shape today. Despite some damage to neighbouring buildings, the ornate, golden temple survived the 2015 quake outlasting various distinct quakes.
Well, while you visit this temple, you would surely note the entourage of five Garudas supported on pillars on the backs of turtles. This is the only place where one would see five Garudas standing back to back in a row. However, the nearest one seems like a devotee rather than the Garuda as in the Dattatraya temple. You can clearly recognize the human face in it. But there are wings too to call him human as well.

Along with such mysterious creatures, there is an ancient stone tap inside the courtyard. Also, the stone scriptures of God and Goddesses. There is a statue of Lord Ganesha on the right side of the temple. Similarly, there is the image of Dasavatar of Lord Vishnu right behind the temple. You can have a guess recognising each of them while existing from that narrow space of the temple.
Nearby, there is a stone image of Goddess Saraswoti. There is even a temple of Chinna Masta, one among the Das Mahavidhyas on the southern arena of the main shrine.

A huge mass of people visits the temple at Ekadashi. Although, people stay up during the Nitya Puja as well. Each day, in the morn and on the eve, the Pujari of the temple performs daily worship. And to witness that, the nearby people especially the senior citizens gather over there. 
Just within a while, you could see the gang of these older people on the premises of this temple who tend to laugh and gossiping in the patis (resthouse) of Suryamadhi, a minute before. They reach over there in such a perfect time as if it’s their daily routine to be there.
And of course, perceiving those glimpse of old people who shares a sort of stories with each other, including strangers like us really brings a smile to your face. Thus, It would be great if you could reach there in the evening, around 6 pm.
Also, there is a belief among the local denizens that if people sit in the courtyard while visiting the temple, the back pain is cured. It is like the blessing of God. So the people of Bhaktapur, still sit there at least once while visiting the temple, even if they are in a super hurry.
Wait, there is more to explore on the premises of this temple. Among several patis and minor temples from the premises, the pati from the end of the east corner consists of more exaggerating wooden artworks. It looks like leaving unavoidable crafting is a sign of the then Nepalese architecture.

There is an even conflict about its name. Some people call it Shiddhi Laxmi temple, some say there is Annapurna inside the temple, and some claim that there is a Sriyantra which is a tantric symbol of Goddess Vatsala Devi.
Thus, let’s call this red temple the temple of Annapurna for now.
The structure of this temple is also unique. It is said that there used to be doors in all directions of the temple. But, today you can see the red brick walls over there instead of those doors. There is only one door in the southern part of the temple.

But, it was not the same scenario a few years back. It has been transformed into that ancient styled pond after a long period. It is said that the pond was once dried up to welcome King Mahendra in Bhaktapur.
As per the cited stories, the locals didn’t find a good and wide place to do a grand welcome of the then King. Thus, they dried up the pond. But, unfortunately, it became a dry meadow and an un-managed field after that.
The concerned authority could not make it to its initial face until Mr Madan Sundar Shrestha, the Mayor of Madhyapur Thimi associated his work and post toward protecting these heritage sites.

These ponds hold a history of at least 300 years. The name of Queen Ganga came whenever the talks start about the erection of the pond. It is said that she erected these ponds to facilitate the locals with a water resource.

Inside the temple, there is a beautiful statue of Lokeshwor (Karunamaya) who is considered one powerful tantric deity. There seems a combined influence of Hinduism and Buddism in this temple.

Some historical facts related to the wood carving museum
Nearby the wood carving museum
Just accessing through the main door and reaching the inner yard would leave you with a big wonderment. But yes, before reaching there, you need to show your yellow-colored ticket to the guards of the museum.
If you already have visited the National Art Museum of Bhaktapur Durbar  Square or the Brass and Bronze Museum, then you don’t need to buy another one here. The same ticket works for you.
The ground floor of the wood carving museum
The rich wood carvings start to appear as soon as you step into the wood carving museum. The windows of the following floors, the struts, and the wooden pillars, make us realize that yes, we are in the woodcarving museum.
In the straight corner, there is a mask of Jayamal often called Jaya or Jai. He was a far-famed wrestler of the Malla era.
In front of it, there is a stairway that leads you to the very top and the third floor of the building.
*On the museum’s first floor, there is a room filled with wall paintings. But nevertheless, you might not call it actually a wall painting because the paintings are painted on a wooden platform that is attached to the room’s walls.
There are paintings depicting the Ramayana and Krishna Leela stories. On the beam, there are paintings of Nava Durgas (Astamatrika), Lord Vishnu’s Dasa Avatar. The room is literally filled with paintings, as there are paintings even on the ceilings.
Now, coming back to the third floor, you will find some of the most exquisite pieces of wooden art over there.
The museum is like a paradise for art admirers and practitioners. There are several statues made in the woods which consist of the statue of Bhairava, Vishnu, Buddha, Nitya Devi, Tara, Bhrikuti, Ganesha, Shiva, and many others.
The most satisfying part of being in the museum is that you can take pictures of these centuries-old crafts.
With the statues, there are torans, wooden pillars, and even boxes (safes) of different eras.
Besides these things, there is one unique thing that indeed is quite different from the ancient newa culture. A tiny window made out of brick, not the woods.
There might be some sort of story behind outputting such a window. Yet, there is one more thing that not only surprises you but also startled you.
After entering the third floor of the museum, you will find a small room on your left-hand side. It mentions that there is a statue of Bhairava with shakti (shakti means his consort) and some wall paintings.
Even after keeping that thing in your mind before entering over there, you would probably get startled. So, keep calm and enjoy what’s inside there.
Some historical facts related to the wood carving museum
The building of the current wood carving museum, which initially came into existence during the reign of King Yakshya Malla with the most epigraphic temple of Bhaktapur, The Dattatreya Temple.
After the blessing of King Yakshya Malla, it was rebuilt in 1763. And again renovated by German experts as the wedding gift to the then King Birendra in 1979.
The peacock window, being the most alluring woodcraft from the 15th century, even today made us come for it. You have to leave the museum to go look for the window because the window is placed on the eastern side of the building. A narrow street facing south (next to the museum) leads to this masterpiece.
Nearby the wood carving museum
The museum, of course, with the dark rooms and brazen woodcraft, showcases the then wood carvings. Nearby, there are some mini souvenir shops with miniature wooden peacock windows. And the brass and bronze museum to share the ticket, for instance.
Besides, there are different cafes and restaurants along with a small old shop, on the left corner of the Dattatraya temple.
However, the earthquake of 2015 made the museum quite terrible. But, it’s worthy enough to widen your eyes for the classics."

Sundhara; the golden conduit of Bhaktapur Durbar Square
About the making of Sundhara
More about the Sundhara
Well, Sundhara is one archaic conduit of Bhaktapur that lies within the Bhaktapur Durbar Square. It aesthetically is a very famous Hiti. Here, Hiti is a term, meaning the taps in the local language. Yes, this conduit that lies beneath the ground level is most commonly known as the Nagpokhari of the Durbar square.
Sundhara of Bhaktapur Durbar Square PC: Sameer Shakya
The conduit and its surroundings are all crafted and decorated through the images of serpents. Things might be the probable reason behind calling this golden conduit as Naag Pokhari. But in the studies, this conduit along with the pond was called Sundhara, which literally means the golden conduit.
You might also find people calling it Luhiti, which also means the golden conduit exactly in Nepal Bhasa ( most commonly known as the newari language).
Sundhara, on the other hand, is a symbol of unique aesthetic grace which is as its name is golden. It has one of the most extricating carvings on the mouth of the spout. The head of a non-castrated he-goat and the figures of different animals and Gods posing in that court really make you say, awe-inspiring.
Furthermore, in front of Sundhara, there is a diminutive pond, in the middle of which an image of gold-plated Naag with a wooden pillar does stand. Perhaps, that’s why people also call this arena Naag Pokhari rather than Sundhara.
Well, around the Sundhara and the pond, you can examine the brick thoroughfare with the stonewall enclosed by the amounts of the serpent including numerous figures of Gods and Goddesses.
Thus, it is unique.
About the making of Sundhara
Bhaktapur and its monuments, never stay emptied without an ambiguous and fascinating story. So, the same goes for this Sundhara.
King Jitmitra Malla, who seems to have contributed a lot to making temples, courtyards, and the palace itself was also one of the most creative kings of Bhaktapur. It is said that one night the Goddess Taleju obliged herself before King Jitamitra Malla, in his dream while the construction of the Thanthu royal palace was on, to the east of Taleju temple.
Know more about the Malla kings of Bhaktapur.
She then instructed him to make preparation for fetching water from the Mahadev river of Nagarkot to carry out the periodic worship of Taleju in the palace.
Consequently, water was then collected from around the smaller streams originating from Mahadev mountain in big storage. It was then diverted into a pond for necessary treatment and finally brought to the golden spout inside the palace through the Royal Cannel (Raj Kulo).
(That pond might be called today’s Mahadev Pokhari, where every year, on the month of Poush/Magh, devotees come and take bath as well as worship at the nearby Mahadev temple.)
The initiated work of constructing Sundhara along with the pond was begun in 1678 (798 Nepal Sambat) and completed in 1683 (803Nepal Sambat).
There is an even more impressive story recounted about this Sundhara. As per the anecdote, on the inauguration day of this Sundhara and pond, religious worship was offered to the Taleju Goddess invoking Tantrik Shakti, and a pair of white ducks were left to flow through this spout.
Legend has it that these ducks easily passed through the mouth of Sundhara turning into a smaller size. They were seen swimming in the pond. This process of appearing and disappearing of these ducks was said to be observed till some generations of the Malla period.

More about the Sundhara
The earliest water source of this conduit was Mahadev Pokhari, Nagarkot which later was taken over by the modern piped system.
However, amid the disruption of Raj Kulo, Sundhara also lost its natural source of water, and today, the modern piped system has been enlarged with the existing infrastructure of Sundhara. Though the water supply is limited and the water streams, for a few hours in the morning and evening for religious worship which also seems not regular.
The water Sundhara was used for the worship of the Thanthu palace. Also, the king and queen used to take bath in this conduit before leaving to have a rest near the Khopi (resting room).
The water of this conduit is still used to worship the Goddess Taleju. However, sometimes, the irregularity of the water flow compels to use of the encaged pond water nearby for religious worship in the Taleju temple.

Among them,  the Salan Ganesh Temple is the one, which lies in the right-hand corner of the square.
A narrow street leads the way to the temple. The temple is particularly special because of the image of Lord Ganesh. But, it is not a sculpture. The image is rooted in a natural stone that has a symbolic form of Ganesha or the elephant-headed image.
Nowadays, it became more indistinguishable because of the red tika, covered all over it.
The Salan Ganesh is also sub-titled as the Adhi Ganesh among the asta Ganesh. During the procession process in Gai jatra, this temple is revolved by a bunch of people. Thus, because of that, it was called Salan Ganesha.
However, until today, the exact erection date of the temple has not been defined. Yet, some guesses call it the temple developed in the 13th century. Sumerialy, the date 1654 also arouses as its erected date.

Salan Ganesh Pokhari
The pond behind the Salan Ganesha Temple is said to be dedicated to the temple. That’s why it is named the Salan Ganesha pokhari. Consequently, the eve made this pond fill with young people as well as the old ones. While, for now, there is no use of this pond except for having a peaceful time with friends.
Furthermore, it is presumed that the pond might have been in existence since the 16 or 17th centuries. From then till today, this pond remains in its initial structure. Along with the length and width of 300 and 150 ft respectively.
Nearby, in the north direction of the pond, there is an Agam Chhen of the respective temple. The architecture is best known for its eccentric display of woodcarvings. All the torans, windows, doors, as well as struts, are shaped in beautiful patterns.

51,The existence of Laxmi Narayan temple in Dattatraya Square,27.673637,85.434959,Nepal,Bhaktapur,Heritage Site,"There are so many Narayan temples within the Bhaktapur Nagar. So that people often get confused about the names of the temples. However, the places and their architecture, distinguish them from each other. The Laxmi Narayan temple stands out as the most unique Narayan temple in the Bhaktapur Nagar. 
Location wise, the Laxmi Narayan temple lies on the premises of Dattatreya Square. That, in the northern arena of the square.
Though this temple was erected in the 18th century, it still bears to stand in between us.
Architecturally, it is made off of multiple roofs. Which is more likely the traditional roofing style of Nepal. Although it is made in a traditional format, it still has some uniqueness. More than any other temple which seems similar to traditional architecture.
Moreover, on the other hand, this tiny heritage site is also a fine example of wood adeptness. One can observe the very well wood carvings in its entrances and torans.
Plus, there is a pair of lions too, in front of its entrance. That generally symbolizes the temple of Devi and the attending vehicles of Mahalaxmi. Since the temple is honoured to both Laxmi and Narayan, the statues of lions were established there. While the entrances are filled with carvings of snakes too.
Furthermore, the Laxminarayan temple is blessed with the pristine image of Laxmiarayan. But that doesn’t mean there are two statues of the deities i.e Laxmi and Narayan.
Instead, there is only one image which generally is of a combined form of Laxmi and Narayan. If you take an attentive look at the statue, then you realize it. That the statue actually has two different figures as well as bearings."
52,Bhimsen temple of Bhaktapur,27.673457,85.4348,Nepal,Bhaktapur,Heritage Site,"There are still several temples and heritage sites in Bhaktapur which has no evidence of their existence. Yet, they are standing in front of us. But, its history is somewhere else. No one accurately knows about them. In those dusting and busts of the city, the erection of the Bhimsen temple also got faded.
Somehow, the archaeologists presume, it was erected in 1605 CE. While some other sources dated it back to the 18th century.
This two-floored rectangular pagoda, the temple of Lord Bhimsen is located right in front of the Dattatreya Temple within the premises of Dattatrya square. Plus, it was renovated lately in the year 2018. However, it is standing in its initial structure until now. As the name of the temple assumes, it is the temple of lord Bhimsen.
The Bhimsen temple is often called Bhisindyo or Bhindyo by the local people.
This Bhimsen temple is extraordinarily large in length unlike any other temple in Bhaktapur. Plus, there are 7 pinnacles crowning in the tiny and pretended tier of the temple.
The windows, doors, and struts alike are filled with beautiful carvings. For instance, the temple is not only blessed with the Bhimsen but also with the statue of Draupati. Here, Draupati is one of the main characters of Mahabharata, who was also the wife of Panch Pandava.
Adding more, the ground floor of its looks like a resting place. Since it is open to everyone and has nothing except a big space. Within the same series, there is a doorway guarded by two stone images. Ultimately, that portal guides to the main temple of Bhimsen.
About the Lord Bhimsen
Bhimsen is a god with a red face, angry eyes, and a thick dark moustache. He is worshipped as the god of trade and commerce. Perhaps, because of that, every household has had its portrait, especially in the shops. They believe that the praying of Lord Bhimsen would bring good fortune and success in business.
Bhimsen
Usually, the local people come and worship in the temple but the traders often come on Saturday to do worship. It seems Saturday is one special day to worship Bhimsen. Besides that, the bhimsen is worshipped especially on Holi Purnima and Yomari Purnima.
Bhimsen pokhari of Bhaktapur
With the temple, a conduit is attached, right to its back. That is a conduit but for some unknown reason, it is also called a pond. That’s why that conduit along with the assumed pond is called Bhimsen pokhari.
Meanwhile, some shreds of evidence show up as the conduit made in the lichhavi period. The northern, as well as the southern steps, still have some sort of carving evidence.  That mentioned the name of some, of the then rulers of Bhaktapur like Raya Malla, Ram Malla, Rana Malla, and Bhim Malla. It was placed during its renovation.
With that, different classic statues like the statue of Narayan with four hands, Chandra, Surya, Ganesh, and some others are also established over there. Similarly, as the attraction, the conduit itself beholds the antique beauty.

According to the temple priest, if anybody obtains the clarified butter (Ghee) of the naval of the Til Madhav Narayan on the fourth day of the Magh, his/her request is granted.
It is a local belief.

As a result, it is also revered as the deity that bestows offspring on followers.

The legends about the Balkumari temple
The temple has a long story, nearly dating back to the 17th century. Of course, cause the temple was established at that time. The legends say that a merchant of Madhyapur usually went to Lubu for trading purposes along with his group. But he somehow fell in love with the princess of the Lubu and vice versa.
Soon, the princess also got pregnant. For that reason, she asked the merchant to take her away with him to the thimi. The merchant happily accepted her proposal but at the same time, he put a condition too.
The condition was that if she wanted to come to thimi with him, she must bring the balkumari with her.
That the princess also happily accepted and brought the deity to the thimi. From that time, the deity was permanently shifted to thimi.
Plus, there is a womb-like structure right above the idol of the deity. That, in some way, justifies the story of shifting the deity by the pregnant woman.

King Bhupatindra Malla erected it in 1698 A.D. Also, picturesque it as Malatichwok. But locals prefer to call it Simhadhwoka layaku rather than Malatichwok. Later, in 1960, the Government of Nepal and the Department of Archaeology set it up as the National Art Gallery.
The National Art Museum was inaugurated by Bishwesvar Prasad Koirala. He was Nepali Congress Supreme and the very first elected prime minister of Nepal.
Consequently, this museum is the best among the three museums of Bhaktapur. You can easily find this place, once you enter the Bhaktapur Durbar Square. The two stone images of lions pleasantly embrace you.

Notwithstanding, this museum has a small acquisition. But, it has a good collection of manuscripts and chronicles, which date back to the 11th century. Similarly, it is the home of ancient Paubha Scroll paintings, tantric cloth paintings. Also, the artefacts of bronze, brass, stone, and wooden images.
This architecture is not in its fundamental shape after the devastating earthquake of 1934 A.D. Yet, was also harmed in the quake of 2015. But, it is protecting a lot of unique discoveries in it. That includes the stone varieties on its ground floor.

As you enter the National Art Museum, you would find a counter where you have to pay and take the tickets. Advantageously, you won’t need to buy tickets for another two museums of Bhaktapur ( wood carving museum and the brass and bronze museum), once you buy one over there.
The tour of the Museum starts with the masks of Nava Durga, the most prestigious deities of the Bhaktapur, and the statue of four-handed Ganesha. Along with that, you can notice some stone inscriptions on your right-hand side.
The next room separated by a door somehow offers you more than the old inscriptions and masks. You would encounter the four-faced shivaling and other reverse statues of Surya, Kubera, Vishnu, Ardhanareshwor, Tara, Laxmi Narayan, and many more.
With that, this floor displays the most erotic paintings of god and goddess, specially dedicated to the Bhairava and his shakti. The description regarding those paintings says that the bhairava over here is shown in an extensive system of yogic union with his shakti, Bhairavi.
Simply looking at these paintings, one can see them engaging in sexual posture but the philosophy of such posture is quite different from what one sees through eyes. Those postures depict the tangible expression of the metaphysical concept that salvation results from the yogic union of the male and female organs.
However, there is one more image consisting of Mahasambhara that portrays the Mahasambhara, one of the popular deities of the Vajrayana cult of Buddhism in his extensive system of Yogic union with his shakti, Bajrabarahi.

The very first floor of the National Art Museum is filled with paintings of different eras.

It also has the classic paintings of Krishna Leela and Madhukaitavabadha.
The images of various kings and princes after King Prithi Narayan Shah are also depicted over there. The very first thing that you would notice over there is those immense memories of the kings.

Moreover, the most valuable thing, that this temple consists of is the statue of the Harihar. It is a combining form of lord shiva and Vishnu. That people call Badri Narayan or Badrinath. That then turns out to be the name of this temple.

The darn says that the initial Rameshwor temple was established by Lord Ram.  For that reason, people call this temple as Rameshwar Mahadev temple but ultimately, yes, it’s a shiva temple. Well, the Rameshwar temple of Bhaktapur is just a replica of the initial one that is in south India.
Consequently, this temple lies right in front of the Gopinath temple. While you enter from the west entrance to the durbar square, you can find this temple on your right-hand side.
The artistic king of the Malla era, King Bhupatindra Malla is credited for such beautiful work.

This temple is popular as the Radhakrishna temple but alternatively, also recognizes under the name of Gopinath temple. Furthermore, This temple is also famous as the dwarikanath temple because of a statue established inside this temple.
The statue established inside the temple is of Lord Krishna. That seems more artistic and admiring. Not only the statue of Lord Krishna but also the statue of Balram and Radha are beautifully placed over there.
There is a guarding image of two stone lions and a standing pillar in front of the temple, which consists of a garuda image on its top. "
62,Jagannath temple,27.6721,85.4281,Nepal,Bhaktapur,Heritage Site,"The ancient evidence says that King Bhupatindra Malla is responsible for the erection of the Chardham temples of Bhaktapur. Along with the Jagannath temple, he also commenced the Badrinath temple, Kedarnath temple, and Rameshwar temple.
Yes, however, this Jagannath temple consists of a place among char Dham temples.
The current temple of Jagannath seems quite ordinary covered with a tin roof.  This one-story temple was three times bigger and of two stories on its erection. The ruinous earthquake of 1934 A.D. somehow spectacularly affects the physical appearance of this temple.
Nowadays, we can see a simple architecture assembled over there. So, it can protect the beautiful wood sculptures of Lord Krishna, Balaram, and Subhadra, erected inside the temple.

63,Chyasalin mandap,27.671989,85.428588,Nepal,Bhaktapur,Heritage Site,"The octangular Chyasalin mandap pavilion is not a temple, despite the fact that most people mistake it for one.
Despite the fact that it is only a pavilion, it is one of the most stunning constructions of the Malla era. The kings of Bhaktapur, however, were not responsible for its construction. The entire credit goes to King Srinivas Malla, the then-King of Lalitpur who erected it as a sign of friendship.
Aside from that, there is an intriguing story concerning the Chyasalin mandap’s construction, which explains why it was built between the Pashupatinath temple and the 55-window palace. There is a Hindu concept that one should not live in front of the glorious deity.
And living directly in front of the Pashupatinath shrine was bad for both the king and the kingdom. Thus, Chyasalin Mandap is reported to be built in between them to avoid the temple’s powerful aurora from directly striking the palace.
This venue once was also a popular choice for the poetry contest. According to published knowledge, King Bhupatindra Malla and his consort once held a poetry competition at this spot.
This pavilion was also used to welcome royal guests, observe festivals, and enjoy the breathtaking sunset views.
Unfortunately, it was destroyed by the catastrophic earthquake of 1934 A.D. and lost its original form. Later, in 1992 A.D., the German architects graciously reinstall this covering at its original speed. They used steel and the ruins of the old chyasalin mandap there. As a result, it was completely impervious to the April 2015 earthquake."

The lanpadegal consists of three newari words. Lan, pa, and dega ( degal). That means road, obstruction, and temple respectively. Therefore, people know this temple as a temple bothering the road. According to this, lanpadegal became the name of this site.
Lanpadegal, before the quake
There was a lovely three-story pagoda-style temple with an outstandingly artistic Harihar statue. According to legend, there were three Harihar temples within the durbar square, and this temple was one of them.
Aside from that, we are grateful that Harihar’s statue has been saved. It is now on display at the National Art Museum. And, those magnificent lions were established in front of the temple before the catastrophic earthquake of 1934 AD occurred in Nepal. Unfortunately, during the tragic earthquake of 1934 AD, that temple fell and was never rebuilt.

Moreover, this shikhara style temple stands right in the northeast corner of the 55 window palace. You can easily get that temple while you enter out from Bhaktapur durbar square to the east.
Also, the established guarding stones will help you to identify that temple. Those guarding stones include a pair of elephants, lions, and bulls. Somehow, these standing monoliths in front of this dome-like temple made you pass its five-layer platforms.
People believed that those five layers of platforms might be the symbol of Pancha Maha Preta. The Pancha Maha Preta include Rudra, ishwor, Vishnu, Brahma, and Sadashiv. The temple is blessed with the Shiva linga which was a mystery until the quake of 2015.
History says that during the reign of king Jitamitra Malla this temple came into existence. Although there is a want of resources about the erection of this temple. 
Silu Mahadev, after the earthquake of 2015

It is stated that the conduit was created to facilitate water for the prayers of adjacent temples, notably Taleju Bhawani, the supreme god of the Malla dynasty. (Taleju temple is located in the palace’s inner courtyard, where non-Hindus are not permitted.)
Aside from its religious significance, the conduit is best recognized for its stunning stone sculptures and carvings. The mouths of conduits are engraved with crocodile and frog-like creatures. Above the water conduit, there is also a tantric image of five-faced bhairava and shakti.
King Bhupatindra Malla is claimed to have repaired this water conduit. Due to a lack of funding, its erection remained a mystery. As a basis, it is assumed that this hiti was already in place while the Yaksheswor temple was being built.
The tap, on the other hand, no longer strained the water. However, it was formerly a popular supply of drinking water for both visitors and pedestrians too."

This temple devoted to lord bhairava is one of the rectangular based temples of Bhaktapur. One could easily recognize this temple as it lies right behind the giant Nyatapola temple.
The Bhairavanath established in this temple is a formidable incarnation of lord shiva, who also prefers to name Kasi Vishwanath and Aakash bhairava. He is somehow famous for his obstreperous and stubborn character. 
Renovative history of Bhairavanath Temple
The shreds of evidence say that the temple was first inaugurated by King Ananda Deva in the 13th century. However, that area, before the establishment of the temple was already popular for the Shaivism pilgrims. It was well known as Lalitmaheshwor. Regarding which there are inscriptions found in the temple.
But, it was definitely not triple-roofed, then. During the reign of King Vishwa Malla, the temple was gracefully restored in a one-storeyed temple.
After, King Jagatjyoti Malla decorated it with golden roofs.
Likewise, in N.S. 788, King Jagat Prakash Malla established his own image along with his minister Chandrashekhar in the temple while having a grand worshipping.
Later on, King Bhupatindra Malla modified it into a triple roofed temple at around N.S. 837-38 (1718 AD) and added the seven golden pinnacles in it. (Renovation of Bhairavanath temple, Bhaktapur Municipality)
The reconstruction took time after the engineering of the Nyatapola temple.

By worse luck, the devasting earthquake of 1934AD collapsed it.  And optimistically reassembled in the same structure. The ruinous earthquake of April 2015 again, made this temple renovated. It also destroyed the tiny way, passing through the betal temple. That ultimately leads toward the interior part of the Bhairavanath temple.
The anecdote about Bhairavanath
With a renovative history, this temple also owns an interesting anecdote, passed orally by our ancestors. According to this, the lord bhairava of Varanasi once visited Bhaktapur to see bisket jatra.
Bisket jatra is one of the biggest jatras of the newar people. During the festival, the lord Bhairava somehow was recognized by a priest and he just cast a decoy spell on him. 
As a quick reaction, he started to sink into the terra firma to go back to Varanasi. But the priest didn’t let him go. As if, he grabs the head of Bhairava in his hand and decollates him with his sword. That’s why people say that the head doesn’t match the body of Kasi Vishwanath. It is also believed that the head is still treasured in a box of this temple."

All of the twenty-four wooden struts of the temple have different images of shiva and shakti. Even the doors have mythical characters, telling us untold stories. You can have a gander at those perfect carvings but their postures are a kind of erogenous.
Those postures are based on the traditional erotic text Kamasutra.
You can easily recognize this temple. Cause it looks completely different from the Vatsala Durga temple which stands behind it. Moreover, people recognize this temple as the Pashupatinath temple too.  And, that’s because it has a phallus established in the temple which looks like as in the original Pashupatinath temple of gaushala, Kathmandu."

The Dattatraya temple is also considered one of the major as well as oldest temples of Bhaktapur.
King Yaksha Malla, who ruled over the entire Nepalmandal from 1428 A.D. to 1482 A.D. is supposed to be the erector of this temple. As per the book, Illustrated Biography of Lord Duttatreya And His 24 Mentors, this temple was built in Nepal Sambat 590 (1470 A.D.) and was only single-storeyed then.

The story behind stone pillars
In front of the Dattatraya temple, one can observe a tall pillar upon which an idol of Garuda (vehicle of Lord Vishnu) is bidding Namaste toward the temple. Visitors who are quite unfamiliar with the Hindu religion might wonder what’s so special about this statue.
Well, it is quite rare to discern this tall pillar of an idol of Garuda in entire Nepal. Also, the facial structure of the statue seems quite unique as it was first considered to have been placed with a motive to set the statue of monk Dev Narayana Giri.
Garuda Dattatraya
But, the monograph did not let that happen, saying that the mortal should not be put higher than the God thus, it ended in a form of Garuda instead of the statue of the mentioned monk. The statue is fairly called the statue of Mahant (the monk) more than of a garuda.

Ugrachandi Bhagwati is known as the furious goddess in the area due to her characteristics. Even her name, Ugrachandi, signifies “the deity of great rage. Here, Ugra means “severe,” while Chandi refers to the angry female deity.
As we all know, King Bhupatindra Malla was a keen individual who enjoyed beautifying the Durbar area as well as building temples. According to legend, he proposed the statue of Ugrachandi Bhagwati in front of Basantapur Durbar in 1707, most likely after it had been renovated.

The palace was finally set during the reign of King Ranjit Malla in 1754 AD.  King Ranjit Malla, the son of King Bhupatindra Malla also contributed a lot to this palace. Unbearably, the tear downing earthquake of 1934 AD demolished the palace.

The first story has doors alternating with small wood carved windows. And the second one is blessed with eleven deep carved windows in the front part. With a slanting torona over it.

79,Vatsala Durga Temple,27.67196,85.428399,Nepal,Bhaktapur,Heritage Site,"Vatsala Durga temple is the white elegance of Bhaktapur Durbar Square. It looks more like the Krishna Mandir of Patan but it’s not the one. It is the temple of Tantric Shakti, Durga that is established in the form of Sri Yantra.
You can see a Kalash as the representation of Vatsala Durga in the temple which was possibly possible to observe only after the quake of April 2015. Before that, the temple used to be locked and people be like totally unknown about what actually is inside this temple?
As we still wonder about the sanctum deity of the Nyatapola.
The goddess once was used to be worshipped from that locked door but today, devotees could enter there and satisfyingly worship her.
It has nine pinnacles altogether. The small ones hold the temples with images of goddesses on the first floor, for instance. Thus, terming this Vatsala Durga temple, the temple of the temples would not be inappropriate. Similarly, the pair of lions and elephants in front of the entrance particularly shows the elegance of the temple.
You can feel the intense carvings by yourself, once you touch them.
Also, there is a big barking bell in front of the temple. The anecdote says that dogs start to bark and whine when it rings. It was established there by King Bhupatindra Malla in 1721 A.D. while he renovated it.
History says King Jagat Prakash Malla started the construction of the temple in 1672 AD. But, it was completed by King jitamitra Malla in 1674 AD. King Jitmitra Malla was the son of King Jagat Prakash Malla. So, this temple holds the contributions of two Malla kings at the same time.
Actually, we can count them on three. There comes a little contribution of King Bhupatindra Malla, after all, in the beautification of the temple.
You can check out the following link if you wanna know more about the Malla kings of Bhaktapur.

By fair means, even after the devastating earthquake of 2015, it is giving pose to the coming generation with the same ethnic speciality but in fresh wear."

It is best suited for relaxation and getting away from the hustle and bustle of the city.
Because it is so close to Suryabinayak Chowk, anyone who wants to go for a walk in the woods could come here. Due to its ease of access, it appears to be the ideal location for vacationers to jump in and be whomever they want.
One can do all sorts of fun activities here, such as tent stargazing, hiking, offroading, mountain biking, dry picnics, and so on. This location is also known as ‘Single Tree Hill’. A Lakuri tree has grown here, contributing to the beauty of the surroundings.
From here, one can see a great deal of Bhaktapur and have one of the best sunsets of their life. If you’re looking for a short hike, Maligaun could be one of the better options. The destination is commonly recognized as one of Bhaktapur’s greatest hiking trails.
Furthermore, there are two ways to get there.
1. Jagati-Nalinchowk-Nangkhel-Prem Shakti Mandir-Maligauun
2. Maligaun – Jagati – Doleswor (There is also a route for motorcycle and light vehicles like cars, jeeps, and vans on this route )
If you take the first route, you will need to take a local bus to Nalinchowk, which will take you less than 10 minutes. You could walk to Nangkhel (22 minutes) and then reach Prem Shakti Mata temple from there (16 minutes from Nangkhel).
After there, you must trek for another hour and ten minutes to reach the Maligaun viewpoint. Apparently, the Maligaun viewpoint is not shown on Google Maps because it is known as the Nangkhel viewpoint.
After some time, you can return by the same route, or you can walk up to Doleshwor and take the bus back. The bus ride from Doleshwor to Jagati lasts about 20 minutes.

Let’s begin it from Nagarkot

Especially, famous for pristine views of glorious mountains and the daybreak as well. You can take a glimpse of eight out of thirteen Himalayan ranges from this height in clear weather.
Adroitly, from the beginning of the hike, you’ll be able to discover the local lifestyles of rural Bhaktapur. Although you’ll be walking through jungles, you feel safe and sound. It is the specialty of the hike.
Normally, this hike took only two hours of the walk as in hike to pilot baba ashram. And there, you can mark this as an opportunity to uncover both the natural and cultural side of Bhaktapur.
Walking through the hills to hit from one hill to another, is an amazing experience. It will be more worthwhile if the views of the Himalayas in the north gives you a company.
From Nagarkot to Changu
Thus, this hike just fulfills your desire to walk along with nature to reach artistic whereabouts. The small village named after changu ends your hike. This village is an example of a mixed culture, where Gurung, as well as the Newari community, are well blended.

It lies in the southern part of the Kathmandu valley at about 160 km and 7 km east of the headquarter of Bara district in Kalaiya city near the Indian border, close to Bihar. The main shrine of the temple contains the scripture of the Goddess Kali known as the Goddess of Power. There are two small brightly painted temples under the banyan and peepal trees spreading their huge branches. The main temple is built in pagoda style with the gajur( pinnacle) on top. The temple is in the plain land of the Terai region . The main pujari (priest) of the temple are from Tharu community.Every shrine and temple of Nepal is surrounded by ancient myths, stories , religious values and legends. This temple s history is also about 250 years old when a simple and benevolent resident of the same village Bhagwan Chaudhary house was robbed ,the thieves were caught by the villagers and were killed on the spot. Bhagwan Chaudhary took the blame on his head to save his fellow villagers from the conviction. He was sent to the jail. The Goddess kept appearing in his dream demanding him to take her to the crime scene. She freed him from the prison and took him to the village where now there is an actual shrine of the Goddess. In return Goddess asked him to sacrifice 5 humans in every five year. Bhagwan Chaudhary being the kind man offered his own life being unable to perform human sacrifice. Instead he pleaded with the goddess to offer Pancha bali (a quintuple sacrifice) every five years. Therefore the World s biggest sacrifice was started in a temple.The temple is the holy and sacred place of the goddess Kali. The main festival celebrated in this temple is Dashain and the Gadhimai mela which is held every five years. The temple is quite packed with the pilgrims from the neighbouring country India. People believed that if the sacrifice is made here to the Goddess they are blessed with their wishes and good fortune. It is estimated that around 50000 animals are sacrificed during the Gadhimai mela. The mela is celebrated for around 1 month from the first week of November to the first week of December. Around 4 million people come to offer their devotions and pray during this period.We can visit this holy place with great cultural value by public transportation. We have to get the ticket to Bara from bus counters to get there or we can reserve the Scorpio to reach there."
405,Thupten Monastery ,27.6061600721939,86.5492821112275,Nepal,Junbesi, Religious Site,"Thupten Choling Monastery is the well-known lama Trulsik Rinpoche fled from Rongbuk Gompa in Tibet to the Khumbu region during the Chinese invasion of Tibet in 1959, followed by a significant group of followers, including anis (nuns) and monks. He spent several years residing at Chiwong and other monasteries while aspiring to return to Tibet. Finally, in 1968, Rinpoche constructed Thupten Choling on donated property close to Junbesi. The monastery needed to be carefully constructed because it started to fall apart in the 1990s. After everything, he saw the location as a temporary retreat and continued to assume that he and his followers would be able to return to the homeland. However, when Chinese dominance over Tibet grew stronger and Buddhist leaders were forbidden from leaving, Rinpoche decided to establish a permanent residence at Thupten Choling in 2001.
The demolition of the ancient structures and ceremonial preparation for the new foundation marked the beginning of Thupten Choling's reconstruction. The friends of Trulsik Rinpoche provided generous financial support from Switzerland to help construct the new monastery, which Michael Schmitz planned. Mr. Schmitz and Helen Cawley, including the architecture, supply chains, and medical services, have overseen all aspects of the project. The rebuilding of the Thupten Choling monastery officially began in the year 2001.
Currently, several hundred Buddhist nuns and monks (80% of them being Tibetan refugees) live in the Thupten Choling monastery. As dozens of newcomers join the monasteries community each year, the population of the monastery only flourishes day by day.
However, the massive earthquake in April 2015 wrecked the beautiful infrastructure. This disaster caused severe damage to the ancient structures. During the rainy seasons, the monastery residents were compelled to live in tents because some of the walls had cracks in them.
The monks had requested financial assistance from Western organizations. The monastery has recently undergone a lot of necessary repairs and modernization, using solar energy for power consumption, electric cooktops for using it in the kitchen, etc."

Bhadrakali Temple in Kathmandu
Bhadrakali is one of the powerful goddess of Nepal. Located near the Sahid Gate at the eastern side of Tudikhel is the temple of Bhadrakali. Also known as Shree Lumadhi Bhadrakali, the temple is considered as one of the most renowned  Shaktipith  of Nepal. A form of Goddess Kali, Bhadrakali in Sanskrit means  blessed, auspicious, beautiful and prosperous  and she is also known as  Gentle Kali . Another mane for the goddess is Lazzapith.The ancient writings in the Vayu Purana and Mahabharat explain the creation of Bhdrakali by Devi s wrath when Daksha insulted Lord Shiva during the great Ashvamedha Yagya (Horse Sacrifice). Tantra Rahasya mentions her rising from the north face of Lord Shiva, (Uttaramnaya Amnayas) which is blue in color and has three eyes.

She is often believed to take on a terrible aspect that is represented with three eyes and four, twelve or eighteen hands carrying a number of weapons with flames flowing from her head and a small tusk sticking out from her mouth.

According to the myths, a farmer used to plough some nearby land and kept his food (bread) on the side. The bread used to turn into gold so the temple got its name as Lumarhi/Lumdi Devi s temple as Lumdi in Newari means  golden bread .
It was built in the year 1817 and was previously known as  Mudule Thumpko . The temple is believed to be built after Goddess Bhadrakali told the priest to dig the hill where they found the statue of the goddess. Since then, the temple lies there and is protected by Nepal Army. It overlooks the Singha Durbar, Prime Ministerial office, on the eastern side.

According to another legend, a tantric practitioner named Saswat Bajra went to Kamaru Kamachya in India and worshipped Shri Bhadrakali. The goddess was happy with him and came to Nepal with him in a holy water pot (a Kalash). He went to run some errands hanging it on a tree at Jamal on the northern side of Rani Pokhari. But Kalika took the form of a small girl and walked away. A farmer met her on his way to the field and questioned her but she fell asleep at the same spot and he went away. He could not find her when he returned but saw Kalika s incarnation instead. Then, Saswat Bajra also saw the goddess and the place was established as the temple of Bhadrakali.

King Ratna Malla started the Astamatrika and Bhadrakali dance together which takes place every twelve years. Also on April 10th, there is a Bhairav Bhadrakali Jatra every year. People come to the temple with the hope of getting their wishes fulfilled. Often marriage ceremonies take place here and also the families sometimes use it as the picnic spot. Maximum number of devotees throngs to temple during Dashain and Ghode Jatra.

Amidst the chaos of the center of the Kathmandu city, one can definitely experience peace of mind at the courtyard of Bhadrakali temple."

The permanent exhibition is titled ""ARCHIVING FOR THE FUTURE"" which is a curated display that explores the juncture of time, architecture, and archives documented through memory and people and highlights the role of archiving in preserving and promoting our shared heritage for future generations.
The Nepal Architecture Archive (NAA), officially founded in 2016, is housed on the sprawling premises of the Taragaon Museum. This growing and versatile archive with rare photographs, books, surveys, blueprints, objects, and invaluable notes serves as readings of Nepal's fast-changing urban landscapes and cultural nuances. Documented over the years by numerous international and local visiting scholars and artists, the archive houses collected and donated material by over a hundred contributors whose research maps histories of varied architectural elements and materials for future understanding and documentation.
Niels Gutschow curated a collection of works by architects, anthropologists, artists, cartographers, engineers, photographers, planners, researchers, and advisors to the government for public viewing across the seven buildings of Carl Pruscha's Taragaon Hostel, converted into the Taragaon Museum in 2014. The fascinating architectural structures with their brick walls, niches, and large round windows proved to be a space that spurred curiosity in the direction of the architectural archive to understand Nepal's (primarily Kathmandu Valley) architectural landscapes and the changes it has undergone over the past few decades. The earlier exhibition display focused on academically highlighting photographs, etchings, maps, plans, and drawings. Taking a cue from these elements, this show of the permanent collection of NAA aims to open up access to a broader audience who will, over time, become the keepers and future contributors of the archive and the conveners of their museum, and their histories and futures at Taragaon Next."

The cave was allegedly discovered in the 16th century by some local men who stumbled upon it when clearing some grass. Within the dark cave they discovered many shrines and statues dedicated to Shiva and other Hindu deities. These included Mahadev and Parvati, Nageswor and Saraswati. Towards the read of the cave the men discover that a waterfall ran through it. Further inspection revealed to them that the water fall came from Patale Chhango (later known as: Davis falls).

Outside the Gupteshwor Mahadev Cave

Before you even enter into the cave itself there are things to see. After walking through the roadside archway you ll have a dozen or so souvenir stalls to peruse. Though you will probably be better off buying in Lakeside or better yet Kathmandu. Before the ticket counter is a a round concrete balcony of sorts. It gives you a close look at the cave entrance and the statues leading up to it. After you buy you ticket you will will enter down the large spiral staircase. It s here where you ll see many modern statues and plaster works depicting everything from semi-clad ladies to bearded men and Nepali deities. There seems to be a take on some of the Kathmandu Valley s erotic carvings here as many of the sculptures are of a sensual nature.

Inside the Gupteshwor Mahadev Cave

As you enter the cave you ll discover how dark it is inside. There is lighting but it s only a series of small light bulbs. A head torch comes in handy as you descend a little to the first unusual sight. A cow shed. While primarily a religious site, the cow is a statue over a Shiva lingam. It s being developed more as a tourist attraction these days.You are free to enter inside the small little tunnel like shed. If you leave a donation you can receive a drink of milk. Though you might have to ask for it too. There is no live cow. Continuing on the 40 or so meters down the cave passing other small statues and shrines you ll come across the main Shiva temple which has a strict rule about no photography. There are guards or caretakers watching out for this. Continue on past the temple to the second part of the cave which is about 140 meters in length. Here the walls open up and you can see some nice colors in the cave walls. Further again and you ll come across a metal staircase leading downwards. You ll hear the waterfall ahead from here. This part is often closed during the monsoon season. Do be careful as the staircase and ground is quite slippery. Once you have descended the staircase you will have to walk across some uneven rocky ground until you get to an area with a view of the waterfall."

The temple mainly witnesses the pilgrims during the month of the Chaitra according to the Nepali Calendar.Kalika Bhagwati Temple is located southeast of the town of Baglung in Western Nepal. So this temple is also known as the Baglung Kalika Bhagwati Temple. The temple is situated on the southern banks of the Kali Gandaki River. Its courtyard has four entrances in each of the cardinal directions. The temple compound contains a sprawling collection of various other temples dedicated to Lord Shiva, Radha Krishna, Laxmi Narayan and Goddess Saraswati.The temple is built in the pagoda style with the three storied roofs and pinnacle (gajur) on top. The bright red colour and metalled roof increases the beauty of the temple. It is surrounded by the trees. You can also witness the bells of different sizes and light pans all around the temple. The smell of the burning incense and the sound of the priests meditating the mantras has the extra soothing effect to the temple. The presiding deity of the temple is Kalika or Kali, one of the fiercest forms of Shakti, the consort of Shiva. Kalika is one of the main goddesses for the Shaiva sect.  Kali is one of the most powerful and dangerous forms of the Hindu Goddess Durga and is often associated with power. Goddess Kali also means   the Black one . She is considered Kali, which also means time or death as Lord Shiva is often considered as  Kala , the eternal time. She is the prime goddess of the Dasa Mahavidyas, ten fierce goddesses of Tantra or the Tantric goddesses. Beside this , Kali is strongly associated with Shiva and Shaivas derive the masculine Kala (a form of Shiva) from her feminine name. That s why this temple has great religious significance in the Hindu religion.According to the Local Folktales, the king of Parbat district King Pratap Narayan Singh Malla received an idol of goddess Kalika as the part of the dowry in his marriage with King Mani Mukunda Sen s daughter. The king thought of keeping this beautiful idol in his own home as the beauty of the fierceful idol was too mesmerizing. The king was returning to his hometown after the marriage ceremony. The bride, groom and others from the marriage procession took shelter in the forest and slept there in the night. On the following day when they woke up in the morning there was a ruckus around them. Not a single person was able to move the idol from that step. So the King Pratap Narayan Singh Malla ordered to build the temple for the goddess in the exact same spot where the goddess had taken rest. The temple was renovated in the late 1990s with other construction of other temples such as the temple of Lord Shiva, Radha Krishna and Laxmi Narayan."

The air buzzes with fervent chants and rituals, culminating in the grand festivals of Chaite-Dashain and Dashain, where thousands flock to pay their respects and seek blessings from the divine.
Legend whispers of the temple's origins, tracing them back to a royal dowry gifted by King Manimukunda Sen to his son-in-law, Pratap Narayan Singh Malla. The idol, imbued with divine power, refused to be moved after a storm-wracked night, leaving the king no choice but to build a sanctuary around it, the very site that now pulsates with spiritual energy.
While tradition once saw animal sacrifices performed within the temple grounds, a shift towards compassion has prevailed. In 2016, the sacrificial practice of pigeons was replaced by their symbolic release, a testament to the temple's embrace of a gentler, more peaceful form of devotion. Whether seeking spiritual solace, admiring architectural splendor, or simply basking in the vibrant atmosphere, the Kalika Bhagawati Temple stands as a beacon of faith and cultural richness in the heart of Nepal.

Top places to roam around in Nagarkot
Nagarkot Buddhist Monastery
Nagarkot is a magnificent place to spend the morn as well as the evening. For that reason, it is called the best natural site of Bhaktapur. But, natural trails are not the only things that define Nagarkot. It has indeed some of the most beautiful spots like the Nagarkot Buddhist Monastery besides natural beauty.
However, till today very few people know about this place. And they who reach out there, frantically admire the place. Although it is a destination, that you can take as a part of your hike this place undoubtedly gives you the abstract of hiking.
Furthermore, this place lies on Nagarkot Ghimiregaun Rd, Baluwapati Deupur. That means a few steps ahead of Nagarkot Tower.
Nagarkot View Tower
Nagarkot somehow is more famous for its view tower. Anyone who steps on Nagarkot can not leave Nagarkot without being in the view tower. Hopping up in a few staircases through a jungle belatedly ends your journey to the view tower. It has a very small area but it is beautiful and yes, peaceful.
Nagarkot Bat Cave
Nagarkot Bat Cave sounds interesting. However, it is not popular as other destinations in Nagarkot. Very few people truly know about it. This bat cave is about 2 km away from one of the adored destinations of Bhaktapur, Muhan Pokhari. So, you can have a better experience of hiking there. With that, one can experience the Yeti Cave too.
Buddha Peace Park

Nagarkot Waterfall and Muhan Pokhari
Nagarkot is more beautiful than it shows in the images. Although it has few cultural values than the other places of Bhaktapur, it covers up all that imperfections with its natural vows.
The Nagarkot Waterfall, Muhan Pokari, MuhanPokhari Waterfall, Jungle, and Waterfall viewpoint, these all places that are simply the grimaces of Nagarkot.  Beautiful as always.
Muhan Pokhari
Telkot
Telkot is a mediating point between the changu Narayan temple and Nagarkot. Also, a small village full of hidden streams and waterfalls. This place is perfect for the green panther as well as for the swimmer who loves to dive into a natural pool. 
Some shrines
There are some local shrines where you can sneak out for a moment in Nagarkot. That includes the Bastola Kul Mandir, Seti Devi Temple, Mahankal Temple, and Kali Devi Temple. Nonetheless, the last one holds a dark history in it.
How to reach there?
Nagarkot is not that far from the capital of Nepal. It’s only 28.8 km away from Kathmandu. That means it takes merely 1 hour and 15 minutes of a taxi ride to reach there. You can also use the local bus which departs from Kamalbinayak Bus Park, Bhaktapur to Nagarkot.
To reach Kamalbinayak Bus Park, you can choose different routes. Like:
If you are staying near Thamel, then you can take a bus from Bagbazaar, which’s last stop is Kamalabinayak. From there, you can take another bus to Nagarkot. However, be sure, to get on the bus to Nagarkot. Since it is a Bus park, you will find buses going to various destinations. (The bus park is known as Nagarkot Bus Park and is located right north-west corner of Kamalpokhari of Bhaktapur)
If you are staying near the Patan area or Jhamsikhel area, then, you can take the bus from Lagankhel that directly goes up to Kamalbinayak. However, you need to make sure that you get on the bus that goes via New Thimi (Naya Thimi) or Naya Bato. And, once you reach Kamalbinayak, follow the aforementioned instructions.
Note: If you are going to visit Nagarkot Tower, then you need to go further south-east following the single road going."

Pilgrims from all over Nepal and nearby countries come to this temple because they are sure that Goddess Manakamana will help them get what they want if they make the trip to ask for her blessings. In the past, the trip meant a hard climb up the hill. But since the Manakamana Cable Car was built, the journey has become easier, bringing in even more tourists and religious people.

The building is very important to history and culture. The story that goes with it is about a queen who was thought to have divine powers but died in a sad way. Later, a farmer is said to have found the spot where the queen was honored as a goddess, which led to the building of the temple.

Today, the Manakamana Temple is not only a place of worship, but also a symbol of Nepal's rich cultural history and spiritual customs.For Hindus, Muktinath Temple is one of the 108 Divya Desams or holy abodes of Lord Vishnu, the god of preservation.

The remaining bays feature scenes from the Ramayana and Mahabharata narrated in Newari script.

Krishna is believed to be an earthly incarnation of Vishnu; hence, images of Vishnu and his mount, Garuda, are found throughout the temple.

The informal foundation of Pranami Dharma was laid during the Braj and Raas Leela (Krishna Leela) in Dwapar,r approximately 5000 years ago in this ephemeral world. It considers Shri Krishna of Braj and Raas leela as an embodiment of Poornabrahm Parmatma or the Supreme Lord. It was founded by Nijanand Swami Acharya Shri Devchandra ji. Hence, the religion first started as Nijanand Sampradaya and later came to be known as Shri Krishna Pranami Dharma. Nijanand also means   Nij (Self) Anand (Bliss)- Bliss of the Self. Our scripture is Tartam Sagar which is also known as Swaroop Saheb, and is a Book of REVELATIONS. It was revealed through Mahamati Prannath approximately 350-400 years ago. Mahamati Prannath ji, was the disciple of Shri Devchandra ji and He is responsible for propagation of its philosophy across Indian Subcontinent. The philosophy helps in a clear demarcation of Self (atma/soul), Overself (par-atma), Supreme Self or Supreme Lord (Parmatma) in the ethereal world and of ego, mind and body in the ephemeral world and goes on to describe the relationship between them. It helps in understanding not only how but also why - the reason- the universe and world was created. Sundarsath (as the followers of Pranami Dharma are called) follow the path of love as is between a Lover and the Beloved. This is only possible if a person is able to rise above the bodily existence and can dwell on the level of spirit/soul while remaining in the ephemeral existence. The philosophy helps in making sense of the various deities, demi-Gods and Goddesses as are expressed in Philosophy of Sanatan Dharma. It expounds on the essence of various religious scriptures of the west and goes on to show that the diversity between them is unwanted. In essence all religions talk about the Same Lord Supreme, but are called by different names. It clearly answers the following questions   Who am I? Where am I from? What is my purpose of being in this world? Who is my origin? What is the relationship with my Origin? The Sundarsath greet each other using the word Pranam, meaning I bow to the spirit in you which is the embodiment of Supreme Lord, Sat-Chid-Anand meaning Truth-Consciousness-Bliss. Any one, who can love One Lord Supreme as a Beloved, is actually following the path of a Pranami, even though, one is not aware of one s relationship with the Lord Supreme. If one gains the knowledge one has with the Lord Supreme, the ease with which one can attain Him is unparalleled. The sundarsath follow a concept of an Asht-prahar (asht-eight//prahar-consists of 3hours) seva pooja (love permeated prayer) to keep a constant awareness of the nearness to and relationship with Lord Almighty around the clock."

Seeing this, the shepherds shouted cheerfully to the goddess. It is worth remembering that hundreds of sheep, goats and herds are sacrificed daily to the Pathibhara Goddess. But at the sacristy, any visitor who has lost blood, limited, can have direct experience and observation. In view of the number of sacrifices offered to the goddess, a pool of blood would have to be collected here, but it would not. That is why it is believed that the blood-goddess Pathibhara accepts the sacrifices offered by devotees affectionately.
Today, the glory of Goddess Pathibhara, belief and faith in the goddess has reached beyond the boundaries of the village, district and country. As a result, thousands of devout devotees from all over the country and abroad continue to visit the deity."

As such, the square remains the traditional heart of the old town and Kathmandu s most spectacular legacy of traditional architecture. The square bore the brunt of Kathmandu's 2015 earthquake damage. Half a dozen temples collapsed, as did several towers in the Hanuman Dhoka palace complex, but it's still a fabulous complex. Reconstruction will continue for years.

The Durbar Sq area is actually made up of three loosely linked squares. To the south is the open Basantapur Sq area, a former royal elephant stables that now houses souvenir stalls and off which runs Freak St. The main Durbar Sq area is to the west.

The temple was empty and even the 'Bajes' (Brahmins) were not to be seen. She sat at the single open door of the temple closed her eyes and prayed. When she opened her eyes she saw a small child, very poor (like a beggar child) in a long ragged garment standing before her. The child said 'lah' (in nepali lah means take) and put something in Padma's palm and closed it.
When Padma opened her hand there was nothing there and when she looked up, the child had disappeared. The incident had occurred in a matter of a second. It was with the blessings of the Goddess Bageshwori that the very next day Thakur Ananda Swarup Singh (father of Padma Kumari Devi) received a proposal for her marriage which he accepted and in 1930 at Singha Durbar,Kathmandu, Padma Kumari Devi was married to Maj-Gen. Mahabir S. J. B. Rana son of Late Shri Col. Maharajkumar Prakash S. J. B. Rana (who was the maker of the Junge Mahadev temple at Nepalgunj) and grandson of Cdg. Gen.

Unlike other temples, this one doesn t have an idol rather a stone-shrine is worshipped as Bhairabh accompanied by Lord Ganesh, Lord Kumar and Goddess Kumari in the inner sanctum. Many believe that Batuk Bhairabh is a family deity of God Minnath. According to the legend, King Amshuvarma of Lichhavi Period built this temple after his return from Prayag visit between 595 CE   621 CE, then Juddha Shumsher Rana refurbished it in 1912 B.S.

Lord Shiva divined himself as wrathful Bhairabh to scare off Brahma and Bishnu when a dispute on who is the greatest of all erupted between these three gods. It is believed that Shiva cut off one of five heads of Brahma when he counter-argued that Brahma was the greatest for being the Creator. According to the ancient text Shakti Sangam from Kali Khanda scripture, Batuk Bhairav was born to kill the demon Aapad who gained a powerful boon from Brahma. Aapad misused his powers to create havoc in all three worlds; heaven, hell and earth. Infuriated Gods to punish the demon for his misdeeds created a five year old boy with their combined powers. The boy was Batuk Bhairabh, the living embodiment of time and space. Aapad couldn t be killed in present, past or future time zones because of his boon, so Batuk momentarily paused the Kalachakra (time), ripped Aapad s body apart and saved the entire living creature.


People worship Batuk Bhairabh to get rid of Sani Dosh, the obstacles created by the planet Saturn. Weak Saturn results in insomnia, laziness, and many physical, mental and psychological losses and not only to oneself but to immediate family members too. In easier terms, life and lifestyle go down south because of Sani Dosh. Worshipping Batuk Bhairabh on a specific day of a week for a specific number of days will help one alleviate their problems. People also feed black dogs, Bhairabh s animal form on Saturdays as a service to Him."

It was built in 1673 on the foundations of earlier temples that had stood here since the 15th century. The temple is a towering Newar-style pagoda with three layers of declining roofs in its physical structure. Sheet metal (possibly copper) covers the roof surfaces, which are supported by 20 struts on the first and second levels, and twelve struts on the upper level. Avalokitevara is shown in a variety of stances on each of the 52 struts, typically with one or more extra sets of arms. There are miniature vignettes depicting scenarios from Buddhist hells, such as boiling alive, on the bottom registers of the struts, beneath Avalokitevara s feet. Other vignettes are of a gentler tone, with lesser deities supporting Avalokitevara on pedestals. The front-facing side (here, the north) is adorned with a huge variety of pots and pans mounted to tables, seemingly defying gravity, as is the case with many Newar pagodas.

This square, four-storey temple with a hip roof made of flat sheets has an air of mystery. The first recorded mention of the temple is from 1702 CE, but its true age is not known. 

Inside, the temple houses the fierce goddess Ugrachandi, the mother deity of the Tamrakar clan. Hence, this gives the temple its Newar name, Tamakahdyah which means  the goddess of Tamkrakars . According to legend, she was brought from Kathmandu to Patan through tantric magic. 

The goddess is still revered in this modern age. Despite holding its ancient religious values, many physical changes have been added to this ancient site. In 1756 and 1761 a beautiful wooden torana was added to the temple. Today, an iconic stone under a copper torana in the sanctum represents Ugrachandi exuding divine peace.

The divinity of this temple is kept alive by various rituals and worship. A Newar Upadhyaya Brahmin conducts daily rituals, supported by the Tamrakar community. Various Tamkrakar Guthi (local Newari communities) involve themselves by sponsoring different religious events at this temple.

Among these events, key activities of the shrine include the regular Ugrachandi worship. This occurs between the full moon of the month Baishakh and the sixth day of the brighter half of the month Jestha. Here also occurs the grand Tahguthi Puha with animal sacrifice and a community feast. 
These vibrant rituals and ceremonies breathe life into the temple, making it not just a structure of stone and wood but a living symbol of the Tamrakar people's faith and culture.

Hiranya Varna Mahavihar or Golden Temple is only a five-minute walk from Patan Durbar Square in Lalitpur. Yet many people in the immediate neighborhood and Kathmandu don t know about it. Though named Golden Temple, it is actually a Buddhist monastery with gilded metal plates covering most of its frontage. The monastery has a ticketing service of fifty rupees for foreigners. When asked what about the Golden Temple appeals to them, a foreign couple said,  We are fascinated by the architecture of this closed courtyard Buddhist monastery which is unique. The carvings have a lot of detail. And, it is so peaceful. This three-roof monastery was built in the 12th Century by King Bhaskar Verma and is adorned with a golden facade, four large gateways, a clock tower, and two lion sculptures. The main priest here is only twelve years old, replaced after a month of service. The place is a serene getaway from the hustle and bustle of the busy Patan alleys.

611,Hasapota Ganesh Mandir,27.680714000175,85.3103069029748,Nepal,Lalitpur, Religious Site,"Housed along the road from Jhamiskhel to Bakundol, the Hasapota Ganesh Temple stands as a beacon of devotion and history. This sacred shrine, established during the illustrious Malla era, venerates Ganesh as one of the principal deities of the Newars. With its statue facing the west, it symbolizes an ancient connection to the spiritual and temporal realms.

The chronicles of its renovation are meticulously inscribed on the right side of the temple. You will find inscriptions recounting restorations from the years 2001 B.S. and 2033 B.S. The temple's current incarnation owes its existence to the Hasapota Ganesh Dharmik Byabasta Samiti, who rebuilt it with reverence in 2075 B.S.

A myth whispers through the ages, telling of a saint from Lhasa who meditated deeply at this site, dreaming of constructing the ""Hasapota Palace."" His untimely death left his vision unfulfilled, but his devotion transformed the place into a revered sanctuary known as ""Lhasa Hasapota."" Over time, this name evolved, giving the temple its current identity. This tale hints at a historical reverence among Buddhists, adding a rich layer to its spiritual tapestry.

Remnants of the Lichchhavi era still linger in the temple's precincts. Here idols of Nawadurga and a sacred Shiva Linga find their home. Behind the temple, an artistic Sattal structure stands as a testament to the architectural beauty of the past. On the right, a complex dedicated to religious bhajans invites devotees to lose themselves in melodic worship.

Among the many rituals and festivals celebrated here, the Dipankar Yatra stands out. The festival is primarily a part of Hiranyabarna Mahabihar. However, it weaves together the vibrant tapestry of the culture of both Hiranyabarna Mahabihar and Hasapota Ganesh Temple.

This temple, steeped in myth and history, stands as a symbol of unwavering devotion, a bridge between the past and present. It is a sacred space where the divine continues to inspire and uplift all who enter its hallowed grounds.

614,Bhimsen Mandir Bhinddyolakshi,27.6738051274792,85.3251814283431,Nepal,Lalitpur, Religious Site,"At the northern edge of Patan Durbar Square, the stunning three-tiered Bhimsen Mandir Bhinddyolakshi temple rises majestically. Its grandeur is emphasized by a singular rectangular base. Two stone lions stand guard at the entrance, symbols of strength and protection. On the western wall, a beautiful colonnaded opening and a door await those seeking divine blessings.

The temple honors Bhimsen or Bhindya?, who is revered as the deity of trade among the Newars. The temple is honored as one of Patan Durbar Square's eight treasures. Lalitpur, famed for its fine arts, houses four main Bhimsen temples. Among these Bhimsen temples, the Bhinddyolakshi temple is considered the oldest one.  Each has its own story and importance, reflecting the lasting devotion to this revered deity.  

Along with its religious significance, the temple also reflects the fine artistry of the Newars. The surface view of the temple in itself is quite grand and easy to notice. However, inside the temple. various shrines of revered deities can be found. When you enter the temple, a stone staircase ascends towards a sanctum where Bhimasena's statue stands. Nearby, statues of Draupadi, Bhairava, and Kali add vibrancy to the temple's ambiance.

Most of the temple's origin s history remains veiled in mystery. Yet, some documentation tells of its reconstruction in 1682 by Shrinivas Malla, rising from the ashes of a fierce fire. Through tremors in 1934 and 1967, it endured a lot of damage yet stood resilient. Despite the scars of the 2015 quake, its doors reopened in 2022 after reconstruction in its ancient form.

This was the capital of the ancient Sakya Kingdom, where the prince was treated to a lavish life of luxury   a way of life that he would ultimately reject to begin his spiritual journey.

When he was 29 years old, Prince Siddhartha left through the eastern gate of Kapilavastu, to start the path to enlightenment as Buddha. Today, you can stand in this exact same spot and look out through the gate, onto the green fields that saw the first steps of this epic journey. This moment has become an important part of modern spiritual journeys.

The remains of the ancient capital are in modern-day Tilaurakot and much of them have been excavated and restored, while archaeological work is still taking place to uncover even more parts of the city and insights into the life of Siddhartha Gautama.

As a major civic centre from about the 9th century BC until the 3rd century AD, there would once have been many grand buildings here. Already, experts have uncovered palace structures, temples, roads and ponds. Some of the artefacts that have been found during excavations are on display at the nearby Kapilavastu Museum.
Tilaurakot is also an important site for Hinduism and you ll notice a rustic modern Hindu temple dedicated to the deity Samai Mai within the ancient walls, where people regularly come to worship.
As you walk through the site at Tilaurakot, you ll get a sense of the scale of the city where Buddha grew up   but you ll also appreciate how isolated he was here, protected by his father. It s not hard to imagine how, as a young prince, he would have looked beyond the walls of Kapilavastu and felt there was something deeper that he needed to uncover.

Situated at 3,867 metres (12,687 ft), the monastery is the largest gompa in the Khumbu region of Nepal. It was built in 1916 by Lama Gulu with strong links to its mother monastery known as the Rongbuk Monastery in Tibet. In 1934, it was destroyed by an earthquake and was subsequently rebuilt. In 1989, it was destroyed for a second time by a fire and then rebuilt with the help of volunteers and international assistance.
Tengboche monastery is amidst the Sagarmatha National Park (a UNESCO World Heritage Site of ""outstanding universal value ), draped with a panoramic view of the Himalayan Mountains, including the well-known peaks of Tawache, Everest, Nuptse, Lhotse, Ama Dablam, and Thamserku.

651,Nepal Folk Musical Instrument Museum,27.6923466406901,85.3144537657499,Nepal,Kathmandu Metropolitan City, Art Gallery,"The founder of the museum, Kadel is not a musician himself but a genuine admirer of the musical traditions. His dedication to his passion has driven him to keep up with his collection and sustain the cultural heritage. The museum now showcases 655 distinct Nepali folk musical instruments among more than 1350 from all over the country. The impressive fact about this museum is that all the musical instruments are either bought or newly made by the local artisans. No instrument is taken from any place where artists still play them. Only those, which are not in use are brought and kept in the museum. That way, the local artists can continue playing live music, keeping up the vibrance of the melodies. 
Folk music is not much in practice these days, which makes it a priority to save them. If it is forgotten, it is not just the music that we lose; we lose our culture, we lose our history. The folk musical instruments are simple, made from whatever is found from the surrounding. Inspired by the sound of nature: the waterfalls, blowing of the wind, mooning of cattle, chirping of birds, even the shape of the instruments is influenced by the nature. The Hiti Manga, for instance, is a fine replica of the water spouts in Kathmandu, producing music similar to the sound of water filled in a pot from the spout.

Only trading routes passed through Pokhara and even at that it was miniimal. The Kedareshwar Mahadev Mani temple is one of the few larger temples in the area.edareshwar Mahadev Mani temple is a new temple based on Newari pagoda design.

It takes about 30 minutes to drive from Kathmandu to Doleshwar. For all Shiva enthusiasts, a trip to Kedarnath is not complete unless they visit Doleshwor Mahadeva and Pashupatinath.
A pilgrimage to these three sacred spots is thought to wash away all of one’s sins and provide an opportunity to receive heavenly blessings from Lord Shiva.
Shree 1008 Jagat Guru Bheemashaankarling Shivacharya, the top priest of Kedarnath, officially designated Doleshwor Mahadev as the head of Kedarnath, one of the Char Dham Yatra, on August 22, 2009.
For the last 4,000 years, the general population was unaware of the connection between Kedarnath and Doleshwor.
Looking back at Doleshwor Mahadev’s history, it is claimed that after the Mahabharata of Kurushetra, the Pandav brothers headed for the Himalayas in seek of Lord Shiva’s pardon for the deaths of many people during the conflict.
But, because Lord Shiva was unwilling to forgive them, he disguised himself as a bull. Knowing about Lord Shiva’s disguise as the fleeing bull, the Pandavas captured the tail of the bull, at which point the head of the bull became split from the remainder of the body.
The remaining body is thought to be in Kedarnath, India’s Uttarakhand state and people have been looking for the head since then.
After a severe flood damaged the temple of Kedarnath in Uttarkhand in 2013, the regular prayers that had been stopped were carried out in Doleshwor Temple.

It might be a coincidence but yes there exist the two famous temples of Bhaktapur.
Saraswotisthan
One among them is the temple of Goddess Saraswoti and another is of the Maha Manjushree. Because of this, people seem to have a little confusion regarding the different names of the same place.
Mahamanjushree temple
Besides, Saraswotisthan and Maha Manjushree temples, that place is also called Lashapake (Lhasapako), Ratnagiri, Mahamandapgiri, and sometimes Thakalmath danda. One can witness the beautiful religious harmony over there among the Buddhist and Hindu religions.
There is not much information about the establishment of the Saraswoti temple but there is an interesting story related to the Maha Manjushree temple.
Mahamanjushree Temple
According to the chronology of Nepal, when Mahamanjushree came to Kathmandu Valley to exalt self-enlightened Swayambhu in Tretayuga, he is said to have resided in Thakalmath danda (Maha Manjushree Danda).
And, after that, he went to outlet the water of Naagdaha (serpent’s living lake) by cutting the gorges of Guheswari, Chobhar, and Katuwal with his Chandrahas Sword.
He is claimed to have settled the Kathmandu Valley after cutting the gorges. In our history books, he is also credited with founding the city of Manjupattan and erecting the throne of a monarch named Dharmakar, indicating that he was already of prehistoric importance.
Accordingly, his activities like staying and meditating at some particular place relatively have to have phenomenal importance. That’s why this place has both religious and historical importance. Besides, it delivers a great view of the Kathmandu Valley, although it is quite quashed with smoke and dust.
Mahamanjushree danda
Since the place was reverenced as Maha Manjushree’s cave, several Buddhist sages and Siddhas are believed to have visited this place. One of them was the great Poet and Buddhist master ‘Milarepa’ from the 11 – 12th century. It is believed that he visited the place at the invitation of the king from Kathmandu valley.
This is one of the important power places for Buddhist practitioners with great positive vibrations.

Again, there is one more belief that every devotee, perhaps, believes in. It is said that in the cave of Maha Manjushree (very well known as the temple of Maha Manjushree), a sound of blowing wind comes and that wind is believed to be coming from Lhasa.
Lhasa, from where Maha Manjushree, himself is believed to have come from.

Also, this Chonga Ganesh temple is counted among those three Ganesh temples of Bhaktapur which create a magical triangle that forms an outer ring of a Mandala. Symbolically, it protects Bhaktapur. The centre of this mandala is said to be either the Taleju Temple in Durbar Square or the Tripursundari Temple located near Sukhudhwakha.
This fact is depicted in the Shri Yantra Mandala, a Newar painting from the 19th century. The painting is still safe on the first floor of the National Art Museum of Bhaktapur Durbar Square.
However, as already mentioned, the Chonga Ganesh temple premises is now more famous for picnics. Each Saturday, the place gets filled with people since it has a good space in between the woods of Salla. Because of those trees of Salla, this place is also called Sallaghari.

It flows through the rural and urban areas of the Bhaktapur district before joining the Manohara River at Jadibuti in Kathmandu.

Locals, in their own language call this place khorhe. However, this place is quite similar to the Pashupatinath too, in terms of having a cremation expanse along with the sack of temples. 
There are significant places of Sitala Mai, Hanuman, Mata Bhagwati, Badrinath, draupati Bhimsen, and Astamatrika. Along with them, there is a huge Shivalinga installed outside the entrance. Some beautiful statues of Buddha, Ganesh, and Ram Sita are also established over there.

Hanumanghat, locally called ‘Khorhen’ by the locals is located at the confluence of two rivers, namely, Brahmayeni Khola River flowing from the north-east side and Tabyakhusi Khola River flowing from the south-east side. The river carries the name Hanumante only downstream of the confluence of these two rivers.
The image of Ram Sita at hanuman ghat
There is a belief with regards to the religious importance of Hanumanghat, Hanumanghat is considered to be located at Tribeni (confluence of three rivers) of Bira, Bhadra, and Tamasa. To them, Bira is Brahmayeni Khola River Bhadra is Tabyakhusi Khola River and the river Tamasa is coming out from the ground.

Besides all of these temples and statues, there is one beautiful statue of Budanilkantha. People worshipped it as Bhujasi Narayan. The statue is said to be transferred over there from one of the courtyards of 99 courtyards of Bhaktapur Durbar Square, after the earthquake of 1990.
Considering all these facets of Hanuman Ghat, it could easily be sanctioned as a religious pilgrim.  While, on the other hand, because it has a cremation area, many people avoid going there at night.
Ghats are said to be an abode of ghosts, evil spirits, fierce deities, and tantric. That’s why it sounds quite scarier too.
hanuman ghat
Ghat is a Nepalese word that means the cremation area. Also, one of the features of ghats is being situated near rivers or Triveni. This, Hanuman ghat is also blessed with Triveni. Triveni generally means the confluence of three rivers. Near Hanuman ghat, a river named Bira ( streamed from Jagati), along with another river named Bhadra (running from Maheshwari) collide with the third river named Tamasa.
It is also believed that the Tamasa river does not pass from elsewhere instead the origin of this river is said to be this pilgrimage, Hanuman ghat itself.
Hanuman ghat during monsoon
Well, there is an interesting story regarding its orientation. As per which, when Lord Ram along with Sita and Hanuman was returning from the after-battle at Lanka, he paused at this place. After some rest and bath, they sat on a stone near the river and started to have fruits.
Meanwhile, Hanuman was in a jittery situation, thinking about sharing foods from the same plate as his master’s. He, in any situation, could not let his master eat the same food touched by his Jhuto hands.
(Jhuto means impure in the Nepalese language. While you are eating, your hands are assumed Jhuto until you washed them. Thus, while eating you are not allowed to enter the Kitchen, temple and another restricted area in Nepal.) 
To resolve his inner dilemma, he founded a new origin of Ganga beneath his tail which we call the Tamasa river nowadays. With the pure water of Ganga, he used to wash his hands each time he took a bite from the plate.
You can imagine, that scene must be quite hilarious. Washing hands beneath the tail that each time when you have a bite. When Lord Ram noticed this interlude, he asked Hanuman that why is he acting this weird just like a typical monkey. 
Which after, Hanuman explained all his dilemmas and deeds. Seeing Hanuman’s this devotion, lord Ram then hugged him tightly. It is said that after that incident the place was started to call Hanuman ghat though.
astamatrika at Hanuman ghat
However, people still believe that one time in a day, Hanuman appears to bathe over there. And, during that time, the way toward this ghat seems vanished or clouded.
Well, that one was an interesting story associating with Ramayan. Moreover, there is one more darn which states that the statue of Balmikeshwor Mahadev of Khorhe was erected by the Balmiki himself. Balmiki is that person who is revered as the author of Ramayana.

With that, the concerned people are developing plans regarding making a 55 feet tall Gorak Nath temple too to develop the area as one of the tourist destinations in the coming years. Although it already is a great place to sneak around.

Out of so many temples why Goraknath?
The actual Gorakhnath temple was Built by Prithvi Narayan Shah and was dedicated to Gorakhnath who was a famous Yogi who traveled widely across India. It is situated ten meters down the southern side of Gorkha Palace. 
Perhaps, because of some connections of King Prithivi Narayan Shah to this place, the concerned people are making Goraknath temple over here. They say that when King Prithvi Narayan Shah was having ease taking five villages, viz., Panauti, Banepa, Nala, Khadpu, and Sanga, he returned to Nuwakot via Changu.
During that journey, he is said to have stayed at Trishul Danda. During his stay, he found that this place is worth making a fort, allowing him to have an eye on the entire Kathmandu Valley. Thus, he made a fort there named Mulkot fort just like the Ranikot fort.
Since the story goes far as there are rumors it is said that he had planned to attack Kathmandu Valley from this fort. In the meantime, it is said that he worshipped Mahankal very ascetically. Hence, this might be one reason behind calling this place Mahankal Trishul Danda as well.
The Trishul danda means the hill station named by the Trident of Lord Shiva but it is more familiar to the locals as the Mahankal Trishul danda. There are more people who even perform their annual Kuldevata puja over there.
There are two natural Shiva Lingam, a tall Trishul, a temple of Shree Santoshi Mata, an idol of Shree Panchamukhi Hanuman, an Ashram of Trishul Baba, a view tower, a Peepal tree, and four-faced Shiva Lingam surrounded by a beautiful garden.

According to the legend, while Buddha was meditating under a Bodhi tree, he was said to be harangued by the demon Mara. Even after the continuous initiatives of mara, Buddha did not resist leaving his meditation. In that meantime, Buddha called to the earth goddess to witness his enlightenment by touching the earth.
The story also stated that the goddess responded to Lord Buddha by sending a flood to wash away Mara and allow Buddha to complete his spiritual journey.

740,Suryabinayak temple,27.656277,85.423521,Nepal,Suryabinayak,Monument,"On the southern hill of Bhaktapur Nagara, there is one sacred temple named Suryabinayak. The temple is situated in the middle of the jungle. It is also called the elder deity among the four popular Binayak temples of Kathmandu Valley including Ashoka Binayak, Jal Binayak, Rakta Binayak and Suryabinayak itself.
Suryabinayak temple
PC: Newah pride
About the naming of the temple, there is one darn adopted by all. In Hindu pilgrim, Surya means the sun who is also worshipped as a god and it is widely believed that the first ray of the sun directly touches the feet of this image of Binayak or the Ganesh. That’s why this Ganesh shrine is named Suryabinayak which means the merger form of the sun and Ganesh.
It takes only half an hour to reach over there from Bhaktapur Durbar Square. If you are not fit to walk enough, then you could choose to ride your own vehicle which will take only 10 min. Isn’t it great?
However, You have to ascend some stairs by yourself to reach the premises of Suryabinyak temple. From the start of the ascending stairs, you could notice temples of different deities until the entrance of the temple premises. Well, the courtyard of this temple contains a pati too which gives a tremendous view of the Bhaktapur City.

Along with the pati, there are statues of Suryabinayak himself, Shivalinga, Malla kings and the mount of Lord Ganesha, Mushak (mouse) over the premises of Suryabinayak temple. There is also a water conduit to wash out before worshipping (Puja).
The physical evidence of the temple states that it was built in the early 17th century. That somehow points to the fact that it was built during the reign of King Bhupatindra Malla. Some rumours also state that it was built by King Vishnu Dev Barma while some say it is old enough to declare its age more than a thousand-year.

There is another interesting folk related to the creation of the forest including the arise of Suryabinayak himself. As per the priest of the temple, when Hanuman was hurrying up to transfer the hill full of medicinal herbs while he was unaware of one medicinal herb named Sanjibani Buti, a small piece of that hill was fall and thus turns down as the hill of Surya Binayak.
If you are well aware of the story of Ramayana, then you could probably be well aware of this incident as well. Coincidently, the hill of Suryabinayak is also full of medicinal herbs.
The temple of Mother Goddess
Aligning with the temple of Suryabinayak temple, there is one more temple, a few steps above the main shrine of Suryabinayak temple. It is called the temple of the mother goddess. As per the locals, it is the temple of the mother of Lord Ganesh. That’s why it is also called Shiva Parvati temple (the parents of Lord Ganesh).
A strong belief stating that this temple blesses voiceless children with an oration made devotees reach over there. People still believe in this myth.
They say that children actually start to speak when they are left in the temple for some time. But they must cry while they are left alone otherwise, they won’t speak. Though this kinda belief is quite strange yet it is a belief that makes this temple so precious."

Events and festivals celebrated in Dattatraya Square
For the reason that it is situated quite far from the Bhaktapur Durbar Square, most people prefer to visit this place at least. However, being the ultimate square to be visited too, it again gives a bunch of surprises to its visitors. This square is named after the Dattatraya temple, where Dattatraya, a part of the trinity is worshipped. 
Dattatraya temple
As the other squares of Bhaktapur, this sort of place is also filled with minor and major temples. If you walk north from this temple, you’ll see a Salan Ganesh temple and behind it a giant manmade pond dedicated to Lord Ganesh. The pond is called Ganesh pokhari.
Salan Ganesh Temple and the pond
Within the area of Dattatraya Square, there are three more temples that hold both cultural and religious paramount. Among them,  this Salan Ganesh Temple has immense importance. During different festivals and events like Gai jatra, the temple is embraced by the devotees.
Salan Ganesh temple
The temple holds an image of Lord Ganesh, but, yes, it is not a sculpture. And that thing makes it quite unique from others. The image is rooted in a natural stone that has a symbolic form of Ganesha or the elephant-headed image. The Salan Ganesh is also sub-titled as the Adhi Ganesh among the asta Ganesh. Sumerialy, it dates back to 1654. 
The pond behind the Salan Ganesha Temple is said to be dedicated to the temple. That’s why it is named the Ganesha pokhari. Some people somehow also called it Yatachhen pukhu. Consequently, the eve made this pond fill with young people as well as the old ones.
Salan Ganesh pokhari
There is another temple in front of the Dattatraya temple, named after the bhimsen temple. Bhimsen is said to be the god of trade. 
Bhimsen temple and the pokhari
There are still several temples and heritage sites in Bhaktapur which has no evidence of their existence. Yet, they are standing in front of us, secreting their history somewhere else. No one accurately knows about it. In those dusting and busts, the erection of the Bhimsen temple also got faded.
Bhimsen Temple
Somehow, archaeologists presume, it was erected in 1605 CE. This two-floored rectangular pagoda locates right in front of the Dattatreya Temple. Plus, it was renovated lately, by the year 2018.
As the name of the temple assumes, it is the temple of lord Bhimsen. Bhimsen, a god with a red face, angry eyes, and a thick dark moustache. He is worshipped as the god of trade and commerce. Perhaps, because of that, every household has had its portrait, especially in the Kathmandu Valley. 
Bhimsen_merchant
PC: Wikipedia
With the temple, a conduit is attached, right in its back. That is a conduit but it is denoted as a pond. That’s why that conduit is called Bhimsen pokhari. Meanwhile, there are no shreds of evidence about this conduit too.
Laxmi Narayan temple
An ever-closed small temple of the premises of Dattatraya temple is the temple of Laxmi Narayan Temple. The temple is dedicated to Lord Narayan and Goddess Laxmi. The temple locates in the northern core of the square.
Laxminarayan temple
These temples had their consequences, besides these temples, two more things made this square so valuable, The woodcarving museum and the brass and bronze museum.
These museums have a large collection of woodcarvings as well as metal craftsmanship of the ancient Bhaktapur kingdom respectively.
Brass and bronze Museum
Brass and Bronze museum
The museum next to the woodcarving museum was also math. The then math, which is now representing a bunch of cases, is all related to the metalwork. And it comes under the name of Brass and Bronze Museum. However, one can enter this museum with the same ticket bought either in the National Art Gallery or the Woodcarving Museum.
The museum is filled with ancient exemplars. Just like the other museum does. But, it significantly has preserved the traditional metalworks. That includes the ceremonial lamps as well as the ritual vessels, which also make it unique from others. In some summon, it is also facing the problems of weaker lighting means.
Wood Carving Museum
Woodcarving museum
The then pujari math of Tachupal Chowk now is a more renowned museum of Bhaktapur. The wood carving museum, which originally came into existence during the reign of King Yakshya Malla. With the most epigraphic temple of Bhaktapur, The Dattatraya Temple.
After the blessing of King Yakshya Malla, it was by some means rebuilt in 1763. And again renovated by the German experts as the wedding gift to the then King Birendra in 1979.
The peacock window, being the most alluring woodcraft from the 15th century, even today made us come for it. A narrow street facing south leads to this masterpiece. However, it also had to face adversity like catching fire.
The museum, of course, with the dark rooms and brazen woodcraft showcases the then wood carvings. Nearby, there are some mini souvenir shops with miniature wooden peacock windows. And the brass and bronze museum to share the ticket, for instance. However, the earthquake of 2015 made the museum quite terrible.
But, it’s worthy enough to widen your eyes for the classics.
Peacock window
There is again one spectacular thing left behind in all these things, the very famous peacock window. You need to adopt a narrow street to reach that place, where you can slacken and peacefully adore the decorative window. Don’t get confused, it’s in the same building as a woodcarving museum.
All you need to do is get out of the museum, then head east, passing the souvenir shop just turn right. And there you go. Cheer your chin up and there is it, the world-famous peacock window.
Dattatraya Temple
Dattatraya temple is one of the oldest temples of Bhaktapur which dates back to the 14th century. And, it is the central attraction of the Square.
The temple is way more unique. Though it is the only temple of Dattatraya in Nepal, it also is acclaimed for its significant architecture. Devotees from all around the nation come and worship there.

Each year, on the fourth day of Biska Jatra (the last day of the Nepalese New Year), a sacred puja used to hold over there. The Kapalik people(Nath community) used to worship the statue of Goraknath, whom they idolised as their chief mentor.

Yes, you can get off the bus at Sanga and walk a little ahead toward the east until you find a way to your left which would lead you to the Latarambeshwor Mahadev temple.
Moreover, the path is quite dusty, somewhere, it is pitched but out of all these Nepalese road’s characteristics, the road adheres us to nature. That soft and cold wind, with a little bit of touch of dust, dabbles you with the favor of remoteness. ( anyway don’t forget to wear the mask, you’ll definitely gonna need it.)
About the Latarambeshwor Temple
Well, the architecture of the temple is recently concluded, which really is so fascinating.
It is said that it took about eighteen years to complete this structure of the temple. At first, the locals, by themselves collected the money to build the temple which later on was supported by the local government and thus this outstanding result came out.
It is an open temple, but unlike other temples that you find in Bhaktapur, it seems a little distinct. The foremost part of the temple is erected using bricks, even in those segments where normally, the wood is used like, in the windows.
The seven pinnacles and other miniature statues of Ganesha, Durga, and Saraswati on whirls of the temple give you a vibe of peacefulness and a complete shrine.

Kalamasi is a very petite agriculture-based village which by acquisitions comes under the Changunarayan Municipality. But it loves to be designated as a village that endures under the western lap of Nagarkot.
The village stays far away from the hustle and bustle of the Kathmandu Valley and is still managing its purity. There are still village settlements, agriculture, and nature, foremost. 
Within the periphery of Kalamsi, there are many more renowned sites of Bhaktapur like the Saraswati temple (the locals of Bhaktapur call it Lashapakhe ), where every year Hindu devotees come to worship Goddess Saraswati and Buddhist comes to Worship Maha Manjushri. 
Along with that, there is Muhan Pokhari, one of the finest weekend destinations which as a matter of the season, blanks out in the winter season. Yet it is quite popular among today’s generations.
In between these tranquil, there is Kalamasi, which has one of the best gifts of nature, the bojini dam and picnic spot.
Historical background of the Kalamasi lake
Bojii dam site was a small pond then and a capacious playground. According to the local people, it was a tremendous place with no use at all. There were no fields nor it was used for any other purpose. So, it used to be called Bajo Jamin. Synonymously, it means a free grassland.
Later on, Bajo Jamin transmitted it into Bojini. And came to existence as the Bojini Damsite and Picnic Spot. However, it is also titled the hidden lake of Nagarkot.
Archeologically, there is no important historical background of the destination. Besides, it was a small village before and momentarily too. But a shred of evidence and a word of the local somehow connects it with history. As per the inquiry, there used to be a grinding mill near the bojini pond. There is no exact conformity but it is said that the grinding mill was built after the then ruling queen ordered it to do so. A specific study might analyze whether it was made in the king’s ruling or Rana’s ruling era.
Furthermore, the present dam site area and the then Bojini pond was a natural swimming pool. The local people used it as a natural pool while foraging to the cows and other domestic animals.

The religious aspect of Changu
The Changu Narayan Temple, according to the evidence, is Nepal’s oldest temple, with distinctive construction and religious beliefs.
Hindus from many parts of the world frequently visit this location. Haribodhini Ekadashi, Naag Panchami, Janai Purnima, Mahashanan, Jugadi Navami, and other festivals attract them. Aside from that, the locals do their daily pujas there.
The legends
If there is a major religious site in Nepal that has no mythology associated with it, then you must be missing something. Yes, in Nepal, it is so obvious that every holy place has at least one story related to its emergence.
And this is where the story of Changu begins…
According to the legend, once a brahmin named Sudarshan traded out his cow to a cow herder (gwala). When the gwala bought her, he started to graze her in the champak forest because of the good availability of green grasses and plants over there.
He had a thought as if he fed her good grasses, she’ll honour him with a good amount of milk. But, that thing anonymously never happens to him. He continued grazing her in the forest. But, the result wasn’t satisfying for him. He always got a tiny portion of milk.
He was so disappointed, thus decided to call Brahmin Sudarshan. As soon as the gwala call him, Sudarshan gave his attendance at the gwala’s place where the gwala describes all his problems to the brahmin. Considering the words of gwala, both of them decide to go and check out the activities of the cow.
As per the planning, they followed the cow while grazing. Surprisingly, they saw a very unnatural incident. They saw a black shaded boy egressing out of an old champak tree and drinking the milk from the cow.
After observing all these things, there were sure that the boy is no human. Perhaps they think he could be the devil. That’s why they decided to cut down that tree from where he egressed and did so. But, the tree starts to bleed as they cut it.
That incident made them so anxious that they started to cry aloud and asked for forgiveness. In the meantime, Lord Vishnu or the Narayan appeared in front of them and explained everything about these incidents.
He explained that he was cursed when he accidentally murdered the Sudarshan’s father during his hunt. He was tugged over there since then. And, forthwith was freed from all his sins, because of them.
Subsequently, hearing all these things, they finally got some relief on their faces. Afterwards, they established a small temple in that arena and worshipped it as the Changu Narayan temple. Where the descendants of Sudarshan brahmin continues to become priest and descendants of the gwala continues to be guthiyars.
Things to do in Changu
As we now, know that Changu is such a complex composition of nature, culture, and modern lifestyle. Your choice of being there could make you do so many things like:

Besides the flanking breeze.

Chaling and the legend behind its name
There are a lot of perceptions about the naming of Chaling. As per one legend, in ancient time, Chaling, before being a village, there used to be a hill named Chaling Dada. From where the wave of water used to flow.  The wave of water in the Nepalese language is called “Chal”. Thus, the place from which the “Chal” is flown is then named Chaling.
Another legend says that there was a dense setup of Tamang people in Chaling and they used to bring/eat meat from Tibbet and Kavrepalanchowk but the skin of such animals was traded in the valley. In their language (In the language of Tamang people), the work of chopping and cleaning animal skin is called Chali. And, from the word, Chali the place is started to call Chaling.
Moreover, there is one more legend left. As per which, the local of that place used to cattle a lot of buffalo. But there was not a good market available for dairy products. That’s why they used to serve the cream that flows over the milk while boiling the milk to their guests.
That flowing cream in the Nepalese language is called “Tar” or the “Chali”. You could probably guess by now. Consequently, because of the Chali that the villagers used to serve and eat, the place began to call Chaling.
Also, there is a saying in the chronicle about this place. That identifies the ancient name of this site, as Gopal Dranga. It was the name mentioned in Kirat and lichhavi era. Nevertheless, this small account of land is full of peace and grace."

Bhadrakali Temple in Kathmandu
Bhadrakali is one of the powerful goddess of Nepal. Located near the Sahid Gate at the eastern side of Tudikhel is the temple of Bhadrakali. Also known as Shree Lumadhi Bhadrakali, the temple is considered as one of the most renowned  Shaktipith  of Nepal. A form of Goddess Kali, Bhadrakali in Sanskrit means  blessed, auspicious, beautiful and prosperous  and she is also known as  Gentle Kali . Another mane for the goddess is Lazzapith.The ancient writings in the Vayu Purana and Mahabharat explain the creation of Bhdrakali by Devi s wrath when Daksha insulted Lord Shiva during the great Ashvamedha Yagya (Horse Sacrifice). Tantra Rahasya mentions her rising from the north face of Lord Shiva, (Uttaramnaya Amnayas) which is blue in color and has three eyes.

She is often believed to take on a terrible aspect that is represented with three eyes and four, twelve or eighteen hands carrying a number of weapons with flames flowing from her head and a small tusk sticking out from her mouth.

According to the myths, a farmer used to plough some nearby land and kept his food (bread) on the side. The bread used to turn into gold so the temple got its name as Lumarhi/Lumdi Devi s temple as Lumdi in Newari means  golden bread .
It was built in the year 1817 and was previously known as  Mudule Thumpko . The temple is believed to be built after Goddess Bhadrakali told the priest to dig the hill where they found the statue of the goddess. Since then, the temple lies there and is protected by Nepal Army. It overlooks the Singha Durbar, Prime Ministerial office, on the eastern side.

According to another legend, a tantric practitioner named Saswat Bajra went to Kamaru Kamachya in India and worshipped Shri Bhadrakali. The goddess was happy with him and came to Nepal with him in a holy water pot (a Kalash). He went to run some errands hanging it on a tree at Jamal on the northern side of Rani Pokhari. But Kalika took the form of a small girl and walked away. A farmer met her on his way to the field and questioned her but she fell asleep at the same spot and he went away. He could not find her when he returned but saw Kalika s incarnation instead. Then, Saswat Bajra also saw the goddess and the place was established as the temple of Bhadrakali.

King Ratna Malla started the Astamatrika and Bhadrakali dance together which takes place every twelve years. Also on April 10th, there is a Bhairav Bhadrakali Jatra every year. People come to the temple with the hope of getting their wishes fulfilled. Often marriage ceremonies take place here and also the families sometimes use it as the picnic spot. Maximum number of devotees throngs to temple during Dashain and Ghode Jatra.

Amidst the chaos of the center of the Kathmandu city, one can definitely experience peace of mind at the courtyard of Bhadrakali temple."

In the same sense, Telkot is famous for its beautiful sceneries too. That includes a glimpse of terraced hills, farms, village settlements, and jungles.
Moreover, it has the most exciting waterways to thrill your day. The minimum 20-30 minutes ride of the bus drops you at the telkot. You can find the buses from the kamalbinyak bus park.
Noticeably, telkot is good for hiking. Besides that, it is also the transit point for travelers, who aim to go to salinadi mela. That occurs once a year, continuing for a whole month."
