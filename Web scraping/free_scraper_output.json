The lines is huge when you get there, but they move pretty fast. You won't have to wait long for your pizza, and it's definitely worth it. I've tried cheese pizza, and the second one is called Margarita, I believe and erd one was supreme. Supreme, in my opinion, was the best for sure, and I highly recommend trying that. Next time I come to New York, I'm visiting this spot for sure!",

The pizza was absolutely delicious - the crust was perfectly thin and crispy, the sauce was flavorful, and the cheese was gooey and delicious. I opted for a classic pepperoni slice, and it was cooked to perfection.\n\nHonestly, given the prime location right on Broadway, I was expecting the price to be a bit higher. But I was pleasantly surprised at how reasonable it was for such a high-quality slice. It's definitely a great value for your money, especially considering the huge portion sizes.\nJoe's Pizza is a must-try for anyone looking for a quick, delicious, and affordable bite in the heart of New York City.",

The architecture is absolutely breathtaking—the circular “spaceship” design is futuristic and perfectly complements the lush greenery surrounding it. The campus is a seamless blend of cutting-edge technology and sustainable design.\n\nThe Apple Park Visitor Center is a must-visit, with its sleek layout, interactive exhibits, and rooftop terrace offering a beautiful view of the campus. An exclusive Apple merchandise add to the charm but too expensive.\n\nThis place truly reflects Apple’s commitment to innovation and excellence. If you’re a fan of architecture, technology, or sustainability, Apple Park is worth a visit!",
