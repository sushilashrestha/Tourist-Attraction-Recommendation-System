I prefer to walk around without a guide, and take my time in the historical atmosphere around me on my own. At the end of the  square tour itself, it is worth going out to the nearby alleys, which also belong to the UNESCO project.",

Well worth exploring, and if you can afford it grab a local guide to take you around and explain some of the finer details. Would suggest two hours minimum to explore, so bring your trekking shoes and make sure you've had your coffee prior (however there's plenty of shops on-site in case you need a top-up!)",

        "text": "Exploring Bhaktapur Square\n\nVisiting Nepal for the first time, I made sure to include **Bhaktapur Durbar Square** on my travel list. Known for its **rich heritage and historical significance**, this iconic site in the Kathmandu Valley truly lived up to its reputation as one of Nepal’s must-visit destinations.\n\nFrom the moment I entered the square, I was captivated by its **wonderful charm**. The intricate architecture of the ancient temples, palaces, and courtyards speaks volumes about Nepal’s glorious past. The atmosphere was **lively and bustling with tourists** from around the globe, all eager to soak in the beauty of this UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nOne of the highlights of my visit was trying my hand at **pottery making**. Bhaktapur is famous for its traditional pottery, and joining a local artisan at his wheel was an unforgettable experience. Though my creation was far from perfect, the joy of crafting something with my own hands made it all worthwhile.\n\nAnother treat that I couldn’t resist was the famous **Juju Dhau**, or “King of Yogurts.” This creamy, sweet delight lived up to its name and instantly became one of my favorite Nepali treats. It’s a must-try for anyone visiting Bhaktapur!\n\nI also took my time to explore every **nook and cranny of the narrow streets**, which were filled with local shops, art galleries, and handicrafts. One of my best finds was a beautifully crafted **Kashmiri shawl**, a perfect souvenir to remember my trip by.\n\nBhaktapur Square isn’t just a historical site; it’s a living, breathing cultural hub. The combination of ancient heritage, vibrant markets, and friendly locals creates an experience that’s truly unique. If you’re visiting Kathmandu, don’t miss this **wonderful place**. It’s a treasure trove of history and culture that will leave you with memories to cherish forever!",
