The architecture is said to be 318 years old, which corresponds to the age of the Nyatapola temple.

This Mahavihar is the place where both the Panchara (Pancha dan) and Samyak Mahadan begin. During Mohani, a kumari is also set up in front of this Vihar. All of this just demonstrates the location’s antiquity and historical significance.

The temple is surrounded by local homes, moreover, the temple’s backside is rather attached to a house too.
Legend has it that when Lichhavi King Narendra Deva was ready to introduce Rato Machhindranatha (Lord Karunamaya) to Nepal, it was determined to establish one of the three designated locations. The contemporary Lokeshwor temple, Silu Mahadeva (Phasidegal), and Aankha Bahal were those three locations.
These locations are claimed to have been picked by a bird who was thought to be Lord Karunamaya’s emissary. The entire procedure was carried out under the auspices of tantrism.
As a result, these sites were regarded as the holiest. When the task of establishing Karunamaya was not completed, Baladeva, King Narendra Deva’s son, established a Padmapani Lokeshwor there.
Padmapani Lokeshwor is a Hindu god who appears to always be holding a lotus in his palm. He is also known as the Lashkar dyo (Laska dyo) and Bhaktapur’s Karunamaya.
The Jet Varna vihar is another name for it. It has Gaju Chaityas, Khamba Chaityas, Bajra Khatu Chaityas, Dharma Khatu, Vimba, Lokeshwor, and Dharma Dhatu Mandir on its premises.

In the names of the erectors, Dev Singh, Jaya Singha and Melu Singha’s names come first. And the very same Devsingha also established a statue of Dipankar Buddha in N.S.749 in the name of his son Devadas.
There is also the image of Pragyaparamita and Avalokiteshwora on the right and the left side of the main deity, Achhobhya Buddha.
The vihar is also famous for a certain event named Barhe Chukegu. It is a part of the traditional Buddhist Chudakarma ritual where the boys of Bajracharyas and Shakyas go through Acharya Abhisheka. The event is more likely considered as a Tantric in grace rite that qualifies any Bajarcharya to become a priest.
During Gunla, daily bhajans (singing hymns ) are regulated there.
However, the torans of the vihar is in bizarre conditions. There are no images of the replicated deity in it. Besides, the architecture of the vihar also seems devastated by the 2015 earthquake. Even though there are people living there.

As per the available scriptures, it was built in N.S. 750. And, fortunately, it is still in good condition, able to perform daily worshipping rituals and participate in Panchadan and Samyak Dan like holy events.
Beside Dipankar Buddha, there stands a statue of Mahankal, Manjushree, Ganesh and Shiva-Parvati, in this Mahavihar tagging the Red Tara. Some folk legends mention that Tara used to speak and was kept inside the bar while she was trying to leave the place.
That is why many Tibetans and people from the Himalayan regions often pay a visit to this place.

Although, there is not much movement in the area, when you cross upon that road, a fragrance of incense steal away your attention. There is peace in the air.
While analyzing the spiritual values of that Mahavihar, one cannot just ignore the architectural form. The combination of the temple and local residents seems quite distinct yet attractive. The struts are as beautiful as the other wooden pieces of Bhaktapur. They are well carved and presented.

There is a beautiful courtyard inside the building where one can find small chaityas and stupa along with exquisite wood’s working and the image of Padmapani Lokeshwora, the central deity of the Bahi.
The vihar is placed in the highland, that’s why it is called thatu Bahi.
The vihar, as mentioned in the inscriptions and scriptures ascertains that it is way older than other vihars. The presence of two Chaityas and a gate with Panchabuddha summarises that it was made in the Lichhavi era.
There is even some chatter saying Na: Pukhu was later made on the land of Thathu Bahi.

The Chuma Ganesha temple, designated as the very first Ganesh temple of Bhaktapur somehow, too falls in such fanciful legends and in weird naming.
Being located in Chochhen tole of Bhaktapur made it geographically the temple situated in the upper part of the Bhaktapur Nagara. It is said that Chochhen originally came up after the term Choye Chongu Chhen which means the house of the upper part.
Chuma Ganesh temple, on the other hand also has its own legendary story. Even the origin of its name has a story. It is said that the rats of that area beyond their nature scared the cats. And when someone tries to investigate the matter, they found out the image of Lord Ganesh.
Chuma Ganesha
Legends say that the name Chuma is derived from the term Chu and Ma which respectively means the rat and line. Thus, assuming Lord Ganesha worshipped by the large line of mice, the name of the temple began to be called Chuma Ganesha.
However, there is one more story that is slightly different from the aforementioned yet the core story of being rats powerful is the same. As per the story, when the king saw a fight between cat and rat and saw cat losing into the rat. He got amazed and follow the rat. There he found the Chuma Ganesh.
After being blessed by him, he was also told that there is Bhadrakali in the south of the area. And he should go there and worship her. The king as ordered went there and worship her. Being pleased by the king, she then gave him instruction to build a nagara in between these two areas; Chuma Ganesha and Bhadrakali temple.
Next, the king establishes the Bhaktapur Nagar along with the first Ganesh temple, Astamatrikas and Astabhairavas.
Besides, the architecture of the temple is likewise quite unique. Although it is a pagoda-style temple, its false tire has multiple layers like design which indeed is unique and satisfactory for the eyes.

The dyo chhen of Salan Ganesh is an exceptional architectural illustration. Unlike other dyo chhen (god’s house), which looks more like a residence but this dyo chhen owns some features matching the temple. Equivalently, it’s rare to find double torans even in temples too.

The flanking stone lions’ home although is declared a world heritage site, yet we are not allowed to observe the interior. Because it still remains occupied by the local resident thus it’s not open to the public.
About the age of the dyo chhen, there is no exact record regarding its erection yet there are some guesses which tells us that it might have been built when the Salan Ganesh temple was built. It somehow makes sense too. Considering, the dyo chhen is of Salan Ganesh temple, it could have been built during the same time period.

Moreover, the famous architect Mr Wolfgang Korn also remarks that it may be incorrect to describe buildings of this type as temples because they are called even on Newari Dyochhens, which means god’s house. However, only the replica of god is quartered over there.
Well, it’s quite easy to find this architecture foregoing the parade of local residences. On the northern alley of Salan Ganesh puku, the last building to the very west is the dyo chhen of Salan Ganesh Temple.

This pond seems like a hidden pond of Bhaktapur cause it is labelled beside the line of various restaurants and local residences. But it is very easy to locate this pond. 
It lies right behind the Shiddhapokhari of Bhaktapur, on the southern arena. All you need to do is cross the road toward the south of Shiddhapokhari. Make the traditional pati to your right( which has a small outdoor shop) and keep going. Within a few steps, you would be standing on the northeast corner of the Bhajupokhari.

Regarding Culture Activist, Om Dhaubhadel, Bhajupokhari was built by a general commander of King Jitamitra Malla, Bhagiram Pradhananga (Bhaju Kasaju/ Bhaju Kasa). By whom’s name, the pond is named Bhajuya Pukhu which means the pond of Bhaju. Later, it started to be called Bhajupukhu and then Bhajyapukhu. However, people also prefer to call it Bhajupokhari which all means the pond named by Bhaju.
Since there is no exact information regarding the erection period of the pond, considering the life ventures of Bhaju Kasa, it is guessed that it probably was built during N.S. 811/812. However, it is no sure date of its erection.
For the reconstruction of the pond, some pre-research and excavation work was also held in that area by the team of Historian and Culture Activist Dr Purushottam Lochan Shrestha. Surprisingly, some facts regarding the preceding temple and its antiquity have been unveiled. 
As per the study, there used to be a shikhara styled temple with an image of Jaleshwor. The temple is said to be built in the middle of the pond just like in the Ranipokhari of Kathmandu.

Today, the layaku (palace) of Thimi is functioning as the Aadarsha Secondary School. Although it is functioning as a school, some portion of this area is still used for cultural activities. The activities regarding Bhairava Dance, Taleju and many other culture-related activities are conducted from here. That’s why it is also called the cultural centre of Thimi.
Besides the cultural values, this place seems important for religious purposes. Each year during Biska jatra the statues of Balkumari are put over there, who is the main deity of Sindoor jatra. Also, the courtyard which has the Taleju temple is remarkably attractive although the section is still under construction.

Most people might have had no idea about this historic pond’s existence before the issue of its reconstruction. The mighty pond is said to be 40 years older than the Ranipokhari of Kathmandu. That’s why the Ranipokhari of Kathmandu used to be called “Nhu Pukhu “ which means the New pond. However, this Ranipokhari of Bhaktapur is not as big as Kathmandu’s.
Ranipokhari of Bhaktapur
As per the historian Dr Purushottam Lochan Shrestha, the Ranipokhari of Bhaktapur was ordered to be built by King Jagat Jyoti Malla, one of the greatest kings of Bhaktapur. It is assumed that he ordered the building of the pond in remembrance of his wife, Queen Rajlaxmi.
The found inscriptions state that it was built in 1687B.S.(1630 A.D, 750N.S.) within a timeframe of 5 months only. Later, it was renovated by King Jitmitra Malla in 1735. During the renovation, several statues of gods and goddesses were believed to be installed there. However, there are no signs of those artefacts in the current Ranipokhari.
Ranipokhari of Bhaktapur PC: bhaktapur.com/Prasant Prajapati
Unfolding history somehow reveals the facts that the pond was severally destroyed during the invasions of Kantipur and Lalitpur in Bhaktapur. Also, the artefacts appeared to be stolen during that time.  
It is said that there used to be a snake statue in the middle of the pond. As per some folklore, there stood the head of the “BasukiNaag” in this pond. Likewise, the body and the tails in the Shiddhapokhari and Na pukhu respectively. 
(These three ponds Ranipokhari, Shiddhapokhari and Na: Pukhu (Guhyepokhari) are considered sisters ponds.)
Besides the historical importance, it has another reason to be an important place to the Bhaktapurians. The Prajapati, Awal, Jochhen, Maharjan, Bhujitu, Rajlawat people of Bhaktapur do their digu puja at the premises of Ranipokhari. Moreover, they certainly perform the Ihi as well as the Bartabanda ceremony over there.

On the southern part of Ranipokhari, there is a “Sattal” which had great use in the past. It is said that when Bhaktapur used to welcome Harishiddhi Naach and Naradevi Naach that used to be held once in 12 years, the dancers, as well as their team, used to rest in that Sattal before entering the Bhaktapur Nagar.

If you have heard or read about Swasthani Barta Katha, then it will be easier for you to understand this matter.
The temple of Siddhi Kali
As per the story, when Sati Devi died after jumping into the Yagya Kunda of her father’s (Dakshya Prajapati) Yagya, her immortal body was carried around by Lord Shiva (her husband). Because the body was carried by Lord Shiva himself, it did not dare to perish. However, because of that, Lord shiva started to live in grief, not caring about the universe. The only thing that he cared about was her body thus he continued to carry her and roam around the globe.
Seeing this despair of Lord Shiva, Lord Vishnu appeared as a fly and make the body of Sati perishable. Which after her body start to fall apart one by one. In that process, wherever the body part of Sati fell, a Shaktipitha emerged in that place. Thus, Shiddhikali appears to be the place where Sati’s right eye fell.

Probably, that’s why it was never known to the world before.
However, this little complex is an important place from the point of view of history, culture, architecture and religion. As per the local anecdotes, the Taleju was first placed and worshipped over here. Later, it was transferred to the current Bhaktapur Durbar Square. Besides, this place is assumed one of the holiest places in Bhaktapur. No meat or sacrifice was ever allowed over here.
Also, during Dashain or the Mohni festival, there is a tradition of displaying a water clock in this Wane Layaku. Wane layaku, on the other hand literally means the eastern palace area. Here, wane means the east and layaku means palace or an important office area in the Nepal Bhasa. So, it actually makes sense, the naming of this place.
The complex, till today consists of the Wane Layaku itself (the Devagriha). It is made in the traditional Newa Agam Architectural style with the beautiful windows of the Malla era. The struts of this Devagriha are also carved with the beautiful figures of different deities.
It is said that there is a statue of Tulaja Bhawani in this Devagriha. With that, there is a Jaladroni (water tank) made in N.S. 770 and a plant, actually a tree in this complex.

Nowadays, people prefer to call it Lamopati (a Nepalese word meaning long inn) rather than Yetachapari. Many of us might have had no idea about its original name before this.
This two-storeyed building was used to sit, to have an audience for the king, and observe cultural programs held in front of the palace or dabali (the traditional stage-like space). However, it is still used to sit and observe several festivals and events. Even when there are no festivals or events, one can simply enjoy the spectacular views of the Royal palaces and temples of Bhaktapur Durbar Square standing behind them.

Tadhuchhen Bahal was ordered to erect by King Raya Malla. An inscription like-board in the Vihar clearly states that it was built in N.S. 611 (1492 A.D). It also states that the Kings: Ram Malla, Raya Malla, Ari Malla, and Avaya Malla collaboratively invited Jibchandra Bajracharya and ceremoniously made him the main Gubaju of the Bahal. 
This vihar is also called Surat Shree Chaturvarna Mahavihar. It is said that the pioneer priest of the Vihar, who was Jibchandra Bajracharya, was also the son of the famous Tantrik Gubaju of that era, Surat Bajracharya. Considering a tribute to him, the initial name of the Vihar was named Surat Shree Chaturvarna Mahavihar. 
Also, about calling the place the Kumari House, it’s not like the kumari of Bhaktapur resides over there. But yes, it is said that the initial kumari of Nepal was established over there. Additionally, King Ranajit Malla also had set some rules regarding Kumari in the place as well.
Perhaps, that’s why it is also called Kumari house. Nowadays, only during Dashain (Mohni), for a week, the former Kumari is brought up here to fulfill some holy rituals.
Things to notice on Tadhuchhen Bahal
The Tadhuchhen Bahal is an attractive component in itself though there are many other things that surpass your imagination. Being in this centuries-old monastery, you might get wonder, conceiving what exactly is this place.  It looks like a blend of Buddhism and Hinduism.
The courtyard of this Bahal is surrounded by a pha-cha (a walkway on four sides) and the enclosed quadrangle is paved with brick tiles (chikanapa). There is a twayamapau i.e. a toran (a semi-circular decorative panel that normally is made either of wood or metal) hung above the main entrance gate of the bahal and above the sanctum as well.

Basically, it is decorated symbolizing the three jewels or the five Buddhas of the deity inside the shrine. So, glancing at them not only made you realize the great artistic views but also the religious aspects of creating them.
Erecting various protective deities is another feature of the Bahās and the Bahis. That’s why you could see the wooden sculptures of Ganga-Jamuna right after the entrance on your right and left in the Bahal. Also, there are statues of Bhairava and Ganesh on the struts to protect the Bahal from all bad happenings.
It is said that the image of Mahānkālto overcomes all dangers and a Chetrapāl protected the shrine.  You would also encounter Stupas and a stone Mandal in the courtyard. There is a belief that the center of this Mandal has a figure of Manjughosh, a form of Manjushree. 
Close to the Dharmadhatumandal (the stone Mandal) of a courtyard, there is a base for sacrifice place called Jogisāla in Newāri. It is used for Homa or fire sacrifice rituals. Plus, there is a statue of panchadhyani buddha with its shakti. Besides all these spiritual monuments, you could somehow, also encounter quite impressive things over there.
Yes, while you are there, don’t avoid glancing at the struts of the eastern part of the shrine. There are some wooden portraitures that portray the punishment of limbo which are returned according to their karma. It is a fact that wherever the temple of Lokeshwor exists these kinds of portraitures also exist.
The image shows two persons with huge stomachs. As per the locals, those big men could eat only one grain at a time. It was their punishment. So, they always starve to the death.

It is located at Suryamadhi, Bhaktapur. A few minutes of walk from Chyamasingha towards the west leads you to this temple.
This temple is also called Wakupati Changu Narayan temple. People who couldn’t go to Changunarayan for prayer choose to go to Wakupati Narayan temple. It is like a substitution of the Changu Narayan temple.
Wakupati Narayan temple and premises
About the erection of this temple, it is said that the temple was built in 1667. However, there is one interesting story regarding the emergence of the Wakupati Narayan, the deity. As per the story, one devotee of Narayan who daily went to Changu Narayan had to stop going there because of the harvesting works.
He was too busy to visit the temple thus he remembers the Narayan, pray spiritually and go to work. One evening when he was returning back home with the sack of paddy, he found the image of Lord Vishnu in his sack. Since it was found within the sack of paddy, it was named Wakupati Narayan.
Here, Wakupati Narayan simply means the seen Vishnu while carrying the sack of paddy.
The temple by date seems more archaic than the Nyatapola temple and is in very good shape today. Despite some damage to neighbouring buildings, the ornate, golden temple survived the 2015 quake outlasting various distinct quakes.
Well, while you visit this temple, you would surely note the entourage of five Garudas supported on pillars on the backs of turtles. This is the only place where one would see five Garudas standing back to back in a row. However, the nearest one seems like a devotee rather than the Garuda as in the Dattatraya temple. You can clearly recognize the human face in it. But there are wings too to call him human as well.

Just within a while, you could see the gang of these older people on the premises of this temple who tend to laugh and gossiping in the patis (resthouse) of Suryamadhi, a minute before. They reach over there in such a perfect time as if it’s their daily routine to be there.
And of course, perceiving those glimpse of old people who shares a sort of stories with each other, including strangers like us really brings a smile to your face. Thus, It would be great if you could reach there in the evening, around 6 pm.
Also, there is a belief among the local denizens that if people sit in the courtyard while visiting the temple, the back pain is cured. It is like the blessing of God. So the people of Bhaktapur, still sit there at least once while visiting the temple, even if they are in a super hurry.
Wait, there is more to explore on the premises of this temple. Among several patis and minor temples from the premises, the pati from the end of the east corner consists of more exaggerating wooden artworks. It looks like leaving unavoidable crafting is a sign of the then Nepalese architecture.

The ground floor of the wood carving museum
The rich wood carvings start to appear as soon as you step into the wood carving museum. The windows of the following floors, the struts, and the wooden pillars, make us realize that yes, we are in the woodcarving museum.
In the straight corner, there is a mask of Jayamal often called Jaya or Jai. He was a far-famed wrestler of the Malla era.
In front of it, there is a stairway that leads you to the very top and the third floor of the building.
*On the museum’s first floor, there is a room filled with wall paintings. But nevertheless, you might not call it actually a wall painting because the paintings are painted on a wooden platform that is attached to the room’s walls.
There are paintings depicting the Ramayana and Krishna Leela stories. On the beam, there are paintings of Nava Durgas (Astamatrika), Lord Vishnu’s Dasa Avatar. The room is literally filled with paintings, as there are paintings even on the ceilings.
Now, coming back to the third floor, you will find some of the most exquisite pieces of wooden art over there.
The museum is like a paradise for art admirers and practitioners. There are several statues made in the woods which consist of the statue of Bhairava, Vishnu, Buddha, Nitya Devi, Tara, Bhrikuti, Ganesha, Shiva, and many others.
The most satisfying part of being in the museum is that you can take pictures of these centuries-old crafts.
With the statues, there are torans, wooden pillars, and even boxes (safes) of different eras.
Besides these things, there is one unique thing that indeed is quite different from the ancient newa culture. A tiny window made out of brick, not the woods.
There might be some sort of story behind outputting such a window. Yet, there is one more thing that not only surprises you but also startled you.
After entering the third floor of the museum, you will find a small room on your left-hand side. It mentions that there is a statue of Bhairava with shakti (shakti means his consort) and some wall paintings.

The peacock window, being the most alluring woodcraft from the 15th century, even today made us come for it.

Sundhara; the golden conduit of Bhaktapur Durbar Square
About the making of Sundhara
More about the Sundhara
Well, Sundhara is one archaic conduit of Bhaktapur that lies within the Bhaktapur Durbar Square. It aesthetically is a very famous Hiti. Here, Hiti is a term, meaning the taps in the local language. Yes, this conduit that lies beneath the ground level is most commonly known as the Nagpokhari of the Durbar square.
Sundhara of Bhaktapur Durbar Square PC: Sameer Shakya
The conduit and its surroundings are all crafted and decorated through the images of serpents. Things might be the probable reason behind calling this golden conduit as Naag Pokhari. But in the studies, this conduit along with the pond was called Sundhara, which literally means the golden conduit.
You might also find people calling it Luhiti, which also means the golden conduit exactly in Nepal Bhasa ( most commonly known as the newari language).
Sundhara, on the other hand, is a symbol of unique aesthetic grace which is as its name is golden. It has one of the most extricating carvings on the mouth of the spout. The head of a non-castrated he-goat and the figures of different animals and Gods posing in that court really make you say, awe-inspiring.
Furthermore, in front of Sundhara, there is a diminutive pond, in the middle of which an image of gold-plated Naag with a wooden pillar does stand. Perhaps, that’s why people also call this arena Naag Pokhari rather than Sundhara.
Well, around the Sundhara and the pond, you can examine the brick thoroughfare with the stonewall enclosed by the amounts of the serpent including numerous figures of Gods and Goddesses.
Thus, it is unique.
About the making of Sundhara
Bhaktapur and its monuments, never stay emptied without an ambiguous and fascinating story. So, the same goes for this Sundhara.
King Jitmitra Malla, who seems to have contributed a lot to making temples, courtyards, and the palace itself was also one of the most creative kings of Bhaktapur. It is said that one night the Goddess Taleju obliged herself before King Jitamitra Malla, in his dream while the construction of the Thanthu royal palace was on, to the east of Taleju temple.
Know more about the Malla kings of Bhaktapur.
She then instructed him to make preparation for fetching water from the Mahadev river of Nagarkot to carry out the periodic worship of Taleju in the palace.
Consequently, water was then collected from around the smaller streams originating from Mahadev mountain in big storage. It was then diverted into a pond for necessary treatment and finally brought to the golden spout inside the palace through the Royal Cannel (Raj Kulo).
(That pond might be called today’s Mahadev Pokhari, where every year, on the month of Poush/Magh, devotees come and take bath as well as worship at the nearby Mahadev temple.)
The initiated work of constructing Sundhara along with the pond was begun in 1678 (798 Nepal Sambat) and completed in 1683 (803Nepal Sambat).
There is an even more impressive story recounted about this Sundhara. As per the anecdote, on the inauguration day of this Sundhara and pond, religious worship was offered to the Taleju Goddess invoking Tantrik Shakti, and a pair of white ducks were left to flow through this spout.
Legend has it that these ducks easily passed through the mouth of Sundhara turning into a smaller size. They were seen swimming in the pond. This process of appearing and disappearing of these ducks was said to be observed till some generations of the Malla period.

More about the Sundhara
The earliest water source of this conduit was Mahadev Pokhari, Nagarkot which later was taken over by the modern piped system.
However, amid the disruption of Raj Kulo, Sundhara also lost its natural source of water, and today, the modern piped system has been enlarged with the existing infrastructure of Sundhara. Though the water supply is limited and the water streams, for a few hours in the morning and evening for religious worship which also seems not regular.
The water Sundhara was used for the worship of the Thanthu palace. Also, the king and queen used to take bath in this conduit before leaving to have a rest near the Khopi (resting room).
The water of this conduit is still used to worship the Goddess Taleju. However, sometimes, the irregularity of the water flow compels to use of the encaged pond water nearby for religious worship in the Taleju temple.

The legends about the Balkumari temple
The temple has a long story, nearly dating back to the 17th century. Of course, cause the temple was established at that time. The legends say that a merchant of Madhyapur usually went to Lubu for trading purposes along with his group. But he somehow fell in love with the princess of the Lubu and vice versa.
Soon, the princess also got pregnant. For that reason, she asked the merchant to take her away with him to the thimi. The merchant happily accepted her proposal but at the same time, he put a condition too.
The condition was that if she wanted to come to thimi with him, she must bring the balkumari with her.
That the princess also happily accepted and brought the deity to the thimi. From that time, the deity was permanently shifted to thimi.
Plus, there is a womb-like structure right above the idol of the deity. That, in some way, justifies the story of shifting the deity by the pregnant woman.

King Bhupatindra Malla erected it in 1698 A.D. Also, picturesque it as Malatichwok. But locals prefer to call it Simhadhwoka layaku rather than Malatichwok. Later, in 1960, the Government of Nepal and the Department of Archaeology set it up as the National Art Gallery.
The National Art Museum was inaugurated by Bishwesvar Prasad Koirala. He was Nepali Congress Supreme and the very first elected prime minister of Nepal.

Simply looking at these paintings, one can see them engaging in sexual posture but the philosophy of such posture is quite different from what one sees through eyes. Those postures depict the tangible expression of the metaphysical concept that salvation results from the yogic union of the male and female organs.
However, there is one more image consisting of Mahasambhara that portrays the Mahasambhara, one of the popular deities of the Vajrayana cult of Buddhism in his extensive system of Yogic union with his shakti, Bajrabarahi.

Despite the fact that it is only a pavilion, it is one of the most stunning constructions of the Malla era. The kings of Bhaktapur, however, were not responsible for its construction. The entire credit goes to King Srinivas Malla, the then-King of Lalitpur who erected it as a sign of friendship.
Aside from that, there is an intriguing story concerning the Chyasalin mandap’s construction, which explains why it was built between the Pashupatinath temple and the 55-window palace. There is a Hindu concept that one should not live in front of the glorious deity.
And living directly in front of the Pashupatinath shrine was bad for both the king and the kingdom. Thus, Chyasalin Mandap is reported to be built in between them to avoid the temple’s powerful aurora from directly striking the palace.

The palace was finally set during the reign of King Ranjit Malla in 1754 AD.  King Ranjit Malla, the son of King Bhupatindra Malla also contributed a lot to this palace. Unbearably, the tear downing earthquake of 1934 AD demolished the palace.
Despite that, the palace was remodelled, using the same windows and struts. But it was not in its usual shape. The palace once was also operated as the post office in Bhaktapur.
55 windowed palace as Bhaktapur city post office.
What’s inside the 55 window palace?
Meanwhile, one can observe the preeminent illustration of wood carvings of the Malla periods in this building. That somehow seems more attractive with black colouring. As you can observe, the first and second stories of the palace had a perfect reflection of wood carving.
The first story has doors alternating with small wood carved windows. And the second one is blessed with eleven deep carved windows in the front part. With a slanting torona over it.
You can notice the carvings of asta bhairava with his shakti. Also, the carved sculptures of Lord Ganesha and Lord Kumar in those toronas.

Bhadrakali is one of the powerful goddess of Nepal. Located near the Sahid Gate at the eastern side of Tudikhel is the temple of Bhadrakali. Also known as Shree Lumadhi Bhadrakali, the temple is considered as one of the most renowned  Shaktipith  of Nepal. A form of Goddess Kali, Bhadrakali in Sanskrit means  blessed, auspicious, beautiful and prosperous  and she is also known as  Gentle Kali . Another mane for the goddess is Lazzapith.The ancient writings in the Vayu Purana and Mahabharat explain the creation of Bhdrakali by Devi s wrath when Daksha insulted Lord Shiva during the great Ashvamedha Yagya (Horse Sacrifice). Tantra Rahasya mentions her rising from the north face of Lord Shiva, (Uttaramnaya Amnayas) which is blue in color and has three eyes.

She is often believed to take on a terrible aspect that is represented with three eyes and four, twelve or eighteen hands carrying a number of weapons with flames flowing from her head and a small tusk sticking out from her mouth.

According to the myths, a farmer used to plough some nearby land and kept his food (bread) on the side. The bread used to turn into gold so the temple got its name as Lumarhi/Lumdi Devi s temple as Lumdi in Newari means  golden bread .
It was built in the year 1817 and was previously known as  Mudule Thumpko . The temple is believed to be built after Goddess Bhadrakali told the priest to dig the hill where they found the statue of the goddess. Since then, the temple lies there and is protected by Nepal Army. It overlooks the Singha Durbar, Prime Ministerial office, on the eastern side.

According to another legend, a tantric practitioner named Saswat Bajra went to Kamaru Kamachya in India and worshipped Shri Bhadrakali. The goddess was happy with him and came to Nepal with him in a holy water pot (a Kalash). He went to run some errands hanging it on a tree at Jamal on the northern side of Rani Pokhari. But Kalika took the form of a small girl and walked away. A farmer met her on his way to the field and questioned her but she fell asleep at the same spot and he went away. He could not find her when he returned but saw Kalika s incarnation instead. Then, Saswat Bajra also saw the goddess and the place was established as the temple of Bhadrakali.

King Ratna Malla started the Astamatrika and Bhadrakali dance together which takes place every twelve years. Also on April 10th, there is a Bhairav Bhadrakali Jatra every year. People come to the temple with the hope of getting their wishes fulfilled. Often marriage ceremonies take place here and also the families sometimes use it as the picnic spot.

This growing and versatile archive with rare photographs, books, surveys, blueprints, objects, and invaluable notes serves as readings of Nepal's fast-changing urban landscapes and cultural nuances. Documented over the years by numerous international and local visiting scholars and artists, the archive houses collected and donated material by over a hundred contributors whose research maps histories of varied architectural elements and materials for future understanding and documentation.
Niels Gutschow curated a collection of works by architects, anthropologists, artists, cartographers, engineers, photographers, planners, researchers, and advisors to the government for public viewing across the seven buildings of Carl Pruscha's Taragaon Hostel, converted into the Taragaon Museum in 2014.

The idol, imbued with divine power, refused to be moved after a storm-wracked night, leaving the king no choice but to build a sanctuary around it, the very site that now pulsates with spiritual energy.
While tradition once saw animal sacrifices performed within the temple grounds, a shift towards compassion has prevailed.

He erected six impressive pavillions, each dedicated to one of the six seasons of Nepal. These pavillions provided the Garden s architectural framework and lent a cosmopolitan flavor to the formal arrangement of flowers, shrubs and trees. Today, only half of the original garden is in existence.

The King ordered a temple built on the same location. During a war with a neighboring kingdom a decade later, the King emerged victorious after calling on Krishna to vanquish his enemies.

The informal foundation of Pranami Dharma was laid during the Braj and Raas Leela (Krishna Leela) in Dwapar,r approximately 5000 years ago in this ephemeral world. It considers Shri Krishna of Braj and Raas leela as an embodiment of Poornabrahm Parmatma or the Supreme Lord. It was founded by Nijanand Swami Acharya Shri Devchandra ji. Hence, the religion first started as Nijanand Sampradaya and later came to be known as Shri Krishna Pranami Dharma. Nijanand also means   Nij (Self) Anand (Bliss)- Bliss of the Self. Our scripture is Tartam Sagar which is also known as Swaroop Saheb, and is a Book of REVELATIONS. It was revealed through Mahamati Prannath approximately 350-400 years ago. Mahamati Prannath ji, was the disciple of Shri Devchandra ji and He is responsible for propagation of its philosophy across Indian Subcontinent. The philosophy helps in a clear demarcation of Self (atma/soul), Overself (par-atma), Supreme Self or Supreme Lord (Parmatma) in the ethereal world and of ego, mind and body in the ephemeral world and goes on to describe the relationship between them. It helps in understanding not only how but also why - the reason- the universe and world was created. Sundarsath (as the followers of Pranami Dharma are called) follow the path of love as is between a Lover and the Beloved. This is only possible if a person is able to rise above the bodily existence and can dwell on the level of spirit/soul while remaining in the ephemeral existence. The philosophy helps in making sense of the various deities, demi-Gods and Goddesses as are expressed in Philosophy of Sanatan Dharma. It expounds on the essence of various religious scriptures of the west and goes on to show that the diversity between them is unwanted. In essence all religions talk about the Same Lord Supreme, but are called by different names. It clearly answers the following questions   Who am I? Where am I from? What is my purpose of being in this world? Who is my origin? What is the relationship with my Origin? The Sundarsath greet each other using the word Pranam, meaning I bow to the spirit in you which is the embodiment of Supreme Lord, Sat-Chid-Anand meaning Truth-Consciousness-Bliss. Any one, who can love One Lord Supreme as a Beloved, is actually following the path of a Pranami, even though, one is not aware of one s relationship with the Lord Supreme. If one gains the knowledge one has with the Lord Supreme, the ease with which one can attain Him is unparalleled.

Wondering why people prefer to visit Bhaktapur?
Despite being only 6.889 square kilometers (overall area of Bhaktapur municipality) in size, it is home to multiple temples and WOW monuments. And inside it, there is another tiny space named Bhaktapur Durbar Square that embodies the richness of Newari art, architecture, and history.
Bhaktapur Durbar Square
In Bhaktapur, one may sit for hours on the pedestals of the rest house or the temples, admiring Shalabhanjika’s magnificent stances. Well, Shalabhanjika is a female figure with elegant feminine features standing beside a tree and holding a limb.
With that, the Bhaktapur Durbar Square offers a religious tour along with a historical sightseeing tour as you can see a kind of an equal number of temples and the surviving palaces and monuments over there.
Bhaktapur, an anciently choreographed city, moreover, is also designated as an open museum. Over hereabouts, you can catch sight of the marvelous erections up until the last 18th century.  Amidst them, the then Royal Palace is one of the most attractive temptations of Bhaktapur Durbar Square.
It is said that the first palace in the current Durbar area was built by King Jayasthiti Malla, in the late 13th century. But, there are no remains left of that initial palace which was then named Yuthuniman Rajkula.
Despite that, the current palace still has a lot to show and tell about the history and
the contributions of various kings.
But one thing is certain: it was at its peak during the reign of King Bhupatindra Malla. He turned this, eternal area into a world of fantastic architecture. That’s why it is also enlisted in the UNESCO World Heritage site (1979 A.D) along with the  Changu Narayan temple, one of the oldest temples that exist in Bhaktapur.
Traveling tip: Walking is the best way to discover Bhaktapur.
Always! A walk through narrow alleys, courtyards, residents’ homes, temples, and then the market. It simply is the best way to explore Bhaktapur.

Let’s start from the west edge of the Bhaktapur Durbar Square
Basantapur Chowk
Basantapur Chowk once used to be a place where feasts and royal parties used to take place. But, today we don’t even have its ruins. What we have left in the name of Basantapur Chowk are the statues of two lions and the statues of Bhagwati Ugrachandi and Ugra Bhairav.
It is said that those images were set by King Bhupatindra Malla after the beautification of Basantapur Durbar which used to stand right behind the gates. 
The sculpture of Ugrachandi
Image of Ugrachandi (Bhagwati)
Ugrachandi is well-known as the most furious female deity on earth. As per the meaning of her name, Ugra means more than anything else or limitless and Chandi means the most furious female deity.
But, why is this sculpture means so much?
Her angry-neutral face, nine pairs of hands full of different types of weapons, the posture of slaying a demon, that slaughtered buffalo, then having a position of giving blessings and all those details on one sculpture is no ordinary thing to create.
Perhaps, that’s why it is mounted as one of the most glorious arts of that period.
One who closely had a look at that sculpture would never say that it is not a masterpiece.
The sculpture of Ugra Bhairava
The sculpture of Bhairava stands right behind the sculpture of the Ugrachandi. It was also ordered to erect by King Bhupatindra Malla along with the sculpture of Ugrachandi. Alike as the Ugrachandi, the Bhairava is also known as one of the most fearsome incarnations of Lord Shiva.
Ugra Bhairava
It looks like, it was the best pair of most furious and fearsome deities of that time. Here, the sculpture of Bhairava is no less than Bhagwati’s. Essentially, the locals call the image of her, Ugrachandi Bhagwati, rather than Ugrachandi itself.
The sculpture of Bhairava here is unique since it has seven pairs of hands holding some type of weapon. Plus, the sculpture is showing his control over betals. However, the details of this sculpture do not end here.
The most amusing fact about this sculpture is that the Bhairava over here had embraced himself with the skin of an Elephant. It is carved very smartly.
Your keen eye would gonna find these puzzle-like carvings if you give a minute to read the details of such a sculpture.
Char Dham Temples in Bhaktapur
Char Dham temples are a set of four temples that are considered the site that helps achieve moksha or salvation. In Bhaktapur too, there are four such temples considered the Char Dham temples.
According to Anjan Sharma, the priest of Char Dham temples of Bhaktapur Durbar Square, the temples were then made to facilitate the common people because the actual Char Dham temples are farther from them. Thus, King Bhupatindra Malla insist to make these temples within the arena of Bhaktapur Palace. 
Badrinath temple
Badrinath Temple
Badrinath temple is now reassembled in its initial structure after the quake of 2015. The temple is made in terracotta style and stands right behind the Jagannath temple.
By the sequence, this temple was erected in the 17th century. Unfortunately, the devastating earthquake of 1990B.S. turned this temple into a Nepalese roofing style temple.
It sounds quite weird. But another devastating earthquake in April 2015 brought this temple into its real posture. Today, the temple is again in the same shape (in the Shikhara style) as it was originally built.
Jagannath temple
Jagannath temple
Jagannath temple is one of the four temples of Char Dham. It looks very common though it has one unique thing which makes it different from other temples.
The statue of Lord Krishna, Balrama, and their sister Subhadra, the images of these statues are quite unusual as they were made out of wood and have such big beautiful eyes.
If you also wish to capture those images, then you must reach there at the time of Nitya puja, daily worship. It normally happens from 7-8 am.
Rameshwor Temple
Rameshwor Temple
Rameshwor temple is one such temple of Bhaktapur Durbar Square that has neither doors nor walls. It only has a Chaturmukhi Shivalinga which represents the Rameshwaram temple of India.
Radhakrishna Temple
Radhakrishna temple (often called Dwarikanath) is the only temple that is made in Nepalese pagoda form among the Char Dham temples. It also has the statues of Lord Krishna with Radha, not Subhadra. And, those statues are made of black stone which particularly might be perfect for the carving of those statues.
It just suits them.
Radha Krishna Temple
You can have their glimpse too if you can make it during its Nitya Puja. Besides the temple represents different forms of Lord Krishna in the formation of strut woodcarvings that you won’t be able to take your eyes off from it, at least for a while.
Well, these four temples are the Char Dham of Bhaktapur Durbar Square. However, people often get confused over actual Char Dham temples since there are five temples in a row including Kedarnath Temple.
Kedarnath Temple
The Kedarnath Temple look-alike like the Badrinath Temple since both of them are made in terracotta form. The temple is called Kedarnath because of the Statue of Kedaraeshwor.
Kedarnath temple
This 17th-century old temple is so eye-satisfying through its eastern pedestal, you can observe the entire durbar area along with the rest house and temple of Vatsala Durga Temple. While from the western or the front pedestal of the temple, you can have a glimpse of the entire Char Dham temple.
On the same lane, you can see a large rest house on top of which is a restaurant. That large rest house is called Yetachapari.
It was quite spacious before the earthquake of 1934 A.D. Unfortunately, the earthquake of 1934 made more temples and palaces of Durbar Square disappear under the ground.
Yetachapari during 1932-1934
Bhandarkhal Chowk
Bhaktapur Durbar Square once used to have 99 courtyards but it is now left behind with some 12 or 13 courtyards. And, Bhandarkhal Chowk is one of them. The chowk is locally called Bhandakha chowk, officially named after the Bhandarpukhu, which is a pond centered on that courtyard. Do you know why it is called Bhandakhapukhu?
Bhanda pukhu inside the Bhandarkhal chwok
The Chowk was said to be the treasury of the state. Besides, it has a mysterious series of stone carvings on the western part of the pond. Some say the stone carving tells a story, related to the ducks and tortoise.
And, yes the entrance of this pond, don’t miss to check that out cause it is the most unique part of the whole Bhaktapur Durbar Square.  The entrance foremost is the only gate that is made out of entirely stone in the entire Durbar Square.
The National Art Museum
The northern alley of the waylays after Bhandarkha Chowk, leads you toward the National Art Museum. This is the only gallery that is treasuring sculptures dating back to the Malla and Lichhavi periods.
National art museum
The museum is home to collections of manuscripts, and paintings of the Malla Ruling era. Plus, it also has the remains of statues from the 1934s destroyed temples. While the gallery itself is the face of the Royal Palace, Simhadhwoka, it is worth sneaking around in it.
With those lions, two more stone images are standing in front of the door, facing south. They are the images of Hanumanta Bhairav ( left) and Narasimha (right).
Statues of Narshima and Hanuman
The statue of Hanumanta Bhairava and Narasimha. These statues are placed right in front of the doors of Simhadwaka Durbar (Currently the National Art Museum), accompanied by two giant lions. By which the name of the palace became Simhadhwoka Durbar means the palace with lions on the gate.
Hanumante Bhairava
Statue of Narasimha
These two images were also anchored up by King Bhupatindra Malla which today, somehow attests to us about the effects of having an affair with stone images. As you can observe, the statue of Narasimha is worshipped regularly, thus it looks quite shabby. 
But on the other hand, the images of Hanuman which are neither worshipped nor touched seem in good condition to this date. Moreover, there is a reason behind establishing these statues and scarce worshipping the image of Hanuman.
Don’t forget to ask about these things to your guide.
The Golden Gate
The Golden gate
Moving toward the east from the National Art Museum would lead you to the outstanding drafting, the golden gate. The golden gate, also known as the Swarnadwar is the last masterpiece left by the last Malla king and reign, King Ranjit Malla.
Though it was the decisive contribution of the Malla reign, it was the best creation of that period.
The replica of Taleju, the symbols of Astamatrika, Purna Kalash (the symbol of good fortune), the Nepalese roofing style, the Ganesha temple, and the current national flag of Nepal. The gate looks like a complete package, filled with Nepalese architecture, carvings, symbols, temples, inscriptions, and noticeable spangles.
So, it’s worth having a glimpse over there before you enter the palace.
55 Window palace
55 Window Palace
Entering the golden gate would lead you to another master of works of woodcarvings,  55 Window Palace. The palace is best known for its fifty-five beautifully engraved windows.
Inspiring which the palace was named Pachpane Jhyale Durbar by the Shah ruler who already was in name Nye Nyeppa Jhya Layaku.
Today, the palace offers us the great wall paintings of the Malla era along with the most immeasurable wood carving of Bhaktapur Durbar Square.
Did you know that this 55 Window Palace once was used as the post office of the city? Don’t forget to have a closer look at the woodcarving of this palace.
Past Post Office of Bhaktapur
Mulchowk
Taleju Temple of Bhaktapur Durbar Square beholds the most powerful tantric deity and is considered the holiest shrine of Bhaktapur. Mulchwok, where the Taleju temple lies as a bar is the most sacred place of the palace where non-Hindus are not allowed to enter.
Even for the locals, some strict rules need to be followed to enter there. Like taking off shoes, prohibiting photography, not wearing leather, and must leave each belonging like bags, right in front of the door.
The Mul chowk then leads to another chowk named Dribhajuchowk through a narrow dark alley. The Chowk has a small pond named Ajima, the Dribhaju Pokhari, or Dwinmaju Pokhari.
Dwinmaju Pokhari
Dwinmaju Pukhu, you can call a secret pond of the Bhaktapur Durbar Square since it lies within the northwest part of the palace and one must cross through the Mulchwok to reach there. And, not everyone is allowed to the Mulchwok.
Therefore, only Hindu people could enter there.
There is a belief that taking bath in this pond can cure ailments like loss of appetite and malnutrition among infants.
Lunhiti Chowk
Luhiti Chowk (Sundhara)
An open tap named Lunhiti means the golden conduit (Sundhara). Yet, the courtyard is more notable than Nagpokhari. That is definitely because of its presentation. You can witness a beautiful stone sculpture of a snake, all cut into pieces, and a pond that has the presence of a stone snake.
However, the water of the pond is not favorable to touch or play with. It’s green and quite uncommon too.
It is also counted as one of the courtyards of the palace which was erected during the reign of King Jitmitra Malla. It is said that it took 10 years to complete this spout.
The Statue of King Bhupatindra Malla
When you get out of the golden gate, you’ll face the statue of King Bhupatindra Malla facing toward Taleju temple. This statue shows respect toward Taleju rather than a king’s self-image.
King Bhupatindra Malla
Also, it depicts the king as a devotee since he is facing north, toward the temple. Today, when we transpired in Bhaktapur Durbar Square, most of us might not notice the statue and its devotional position, of course.
But, in the evening, from the pedestal of 55 window palaces, you couldn’t deny saying that the statue looks much more beautiful than anything else at Bhaktapur Durbar Square. It’s just pristine.
Isn’t it interesting talking about the kings and their stories? Well, we have another article about the Malla Kings of Bhaktapur. You can check that out too.
Besides these monuments, there is still some more to explore in Bhaktapur Durbar Square.
Vastala Durga Temple
Vatsala Durga Temple
Vatsala Durga temple is the white elegance of Bhaktapur Durbar Square. It looks more like the Krishna Mandir of Patan but it’s not the one. It is the temple of Tantric Shakti, Durga that in the form of Sri Yantra.
You can see a Kalash as the representation of Vatsala Durga in the temple which was possibly possible to observe only after the quake of April 2015. Before that, the temple used to be locked and people be like totally unknown of what is inside this temple.
Besides, the temple has a barking bell hung right in front of it accompanying the beautiful stone creatures’ elephants, and lions. The anecdote says that dogs start to bark and whine when it rings. The barking bell was established there by King Bhupatindra Malla in 1721 A.D. while he rehabilitated the temple.
Pashupatinath Temple
The Pashupatinath Temple or the Yakheshwor Temple of Bhaktapur have some similarities as well as a difference to the genuine temple of Pashupatinath, which lies in Kathmandu Valley. The temple was erected by King Yakshya Malla. Accordingly, the name of the temple ended up as Yakshyeshwor Mahadev temple.
Pashupatinath temple
Despite that, it is considered one of the oldest temples of Bhaktapur. The temple is one among those which have some erotic carvings. It is believed that the then king made make that kind of carvings to give sex education to the locals.
Plus, there is another belief that tells that those kinds of carving prevent temples from thunderbolt strikes.
Chyasalin Mandap
Chyasalin Mandap. PC: Prasant Prajapati
Chayalin mandap is not a temple. It was built to receive guests and attend different occasions by royal personalities. Yet, more stories tell it was made to stop the aurora of Pashupatinath which was slightly direct to the Royal Palace.
And it is still assumed to not be a good sign to have direct sight of a temple in front of any residence in Bhaktapur. So, people made an alternate architecture to avoid that aurora.
That’s why the Chyasalim mandap rests right in between the Pashupatinath temple and 55 windowed palaces.
Shankar Narayan temple
Shankharnarayan temple

Siddhi Laxmi Temple
Siddhi Laxmi temple of Bhaktapur Durbar Square is also called Lohan Dega, the stone temple. The temple is as beautiful as the Vatsala Durga temple but undoubtedly has more guardians.
As per some folk talks, the very first pair of guardians of the temple is related to then’s society and human behavior. It simply shows what happens when a child is raised by a father or a mother. The difference is shown there, all you need to do is go and find it.

Phasidegal temple
Phasidegal was once claimed as the tallest temple of Bhaktapur Durbar Square, even of the entire Bhaktapur Nagar, and that once upon a time was the time before the emergence of Nyatapola. Well, there are a lot of rumors related to these two temples. You must catch one local guide of Bhaktapur if you wanna know more and more about such stories and uncovered mysteries of Bhaktapur. 
Coming back to the temple, this temple is called Phasidega because it looks like a pumpkin. Yes, here Phasi means the Pumpkin and Dega means the god. Though the temple is often called Silu Mahadev and Ta: Ja Dega.

Ways to reach Bhaktapur Durbar Square from Kathmandu
Few ways that would easily navigate you to the Bhaktapur Durbar area.
Bhaktapur buses leave from the Ratna Park Bus Stand and Bagbazar Bus Stand. Better to take a bus that goes to Kamalbinayak Bus Park from Bagbazar Bus Stand. It would be great if you find the one which passes the Shiddhapokhari. Get off the bus when you reach Sano Byasi, the Tourist Bus Park of Bhaktapur. Bus charges are around Rs 35-50. From there, you have to walk for a bit to reach Durbar Square. Asking any residents would be a great help though, just walk straight until you find a staircase (behind a temple of Indrayani). Following that way, you would reach Durbar Square Gate within 3-4 minutes.
By any chance, you took the wrong bus. Even then, you don’t have to worry about it. All you need to do is get off at the Suryabinayak Bus Stop. And then, walk toward the east until you find a way to wave toward the north. Just follow the same route, and cross the bridge, with that you would pass the alleys of pottery square, then Taumadhi Square and finally you will reach Bhaktapur Durbar Square.
Anywhere from Kathmandu, you can take a taxi. The normal taxi charge from Tribhuvan International Airport is around Rs.1000. The taxi drivers may ask for up to Rs 1500. And yes, you can bargain, if you can 🙂

In such an unimaginable event, the Goddess gave a vision to the stunned and bewildered shepherds, instructing them to worship the sheep without sacrificing their origins and motifs.
Attentive shepherds sacrificed the most noble lamb by offering devotional worship at the Goddess-shaped site. What was more sacrificed was the hundreds of lost sheep that had appeared in the same place as before, the blood of the sacrificial lambs falling to the slaughter as water lost in the sand.
Seeing this, the shepherds shouted cheerfully to the goddess. It is worth remembering that hundreds of sheep, goats and herds are sacrificed daily to the Pathibhara Goddess. But at the sacristy, any visitor who has lost blood, limited, can have direct experience and observation. In view of the number of sacrifices offered to the goddess, a pool of blood would have to be collected here, but it would not.

266,584,585,Jaya Bageshwori Temple, Religious Site,Unknown,Nepal,27.71073721,85.34412369,"A miracle at the Bageshwori temple - In 1926 ( Nepali calendar 1983) Padma Kumari Devi Singh (11 yrs) who lived in Kailash Bhawan, Gharbari Tole road (Ward-2), Nepalgunj, went to pray at the Bageshwori temple as on that day she was very sad. The temple was empty and even the 'Bajes' (Brahmins) were not to be seen. She sat at the single open door of the temple closed her eyes and prayed. When she opened her eyes she saw a small child, very poor (like a beggar child) in a long ragged garment standing before her. The child said 'lah' (in nepali lah means take) and put something in Padma's palm and closed it.
When Padma opened her hand there was nothing there and when she looked up, the child had disappeared. The incident had occurred in a matter of a second. It was with the blessings of the Goddess Bageshwori that the very next day Thakur Ananda Swarup Singh (father of Padma Kumari Devi) received a proposal for her marriage which he accepted and in 1930 at Singha Durbar,Kathmandu, Padma Kumari Devi was married to Maj-Gen. Mahabir S. J. B. Rana son of Late Shri Col. Maharajkumar Prakash S. J. B. Rana (who was the maker of the Junge Mahadev temple at Nepalgunj) and grandson of Cdg. Gen. Shri Tin Maharaj Sir Bhim Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana, Maharaj of Lamjanj and Kaski, who was Prime Minister of Nepal. Since then the number of visitors in the temple has increased at a very high rate.
People believe that whatever they would wish for there, would be granted to them. With the blessings of the Goddess Bageswori, Maj. Gen. Mahabir S. J. B. Rana was Gov. of Ilam, Nepal, Gov. Dhankuta (he was the first to modernise the tea estates in the late 1930s & early 1940s), Mbr Advisory Assembly-1951, Minister for Planning & Development: 1951-1955, Mines, Electricity, Forest-1951-1953, Home-Affairs-1953-1954, Industry & Commerce-1953-1955, Agriculture & Food-1953-1955 and Civil Supplies-1953-1954, Nepal.

Unlike other temples, this one doesn t have an idol rather a stone-shrine is worshipped as Bhairabh accompanied by Lord Ganesh, Lord Kumar and Goddess Kumari in the inner sanctum. Many believe that Batuk Bhairabh is a family deity of God Minnath. According to the legend, King Amshuvarma of Lichhavi Period built this temple after his return from Prayag visit between 595 CE   621 CE, then Juddha Shumsher Rana refurbished it in 1912 B.S.

Lord Shiva divined himself as wrathful Bhairabh to scare off Brahma and Bishnu when a dispute on who is the greatest of all erupted between these three gods. It is believed that Shiva cut off one of five heads of Brahma when he counter-argued that Brahma was the greatest for being the Creator. According to the ancient text Shakti Sangam from Kali Khanda scripture, Batuk Bhairav was born to kill the demon Aapad who gained a powerful boon from Brahma. Aapad misused his powers to create havoc in all three worlds; heaven, hell and earth. Infuriated Gods to punish the demon for his misdeeds created a five year old boy with their combined powers. The boy was Batuk Bhairabh, the living embodiment of time and space. Aapad couldn t be killed in present, past or future time zones because of his boon, so Batuk momentarily paused the Kalachakra (time), ripped Aapad s body apart and saved the entire living creature.


People worship Batuk Bhairabh to get rid of Sani Dosh, the obstacles created by the planet Saturn. Weak Saturn results in insomnia, laziness, and many physical, mental and psychological losses and not only to oneself but to immediate family members too. In easier terms, life and lifestyle go down south because of Sani Dosh. Worshipping Batuk Bhairabh on a specific day of a week for a specific number of days will help one alleviate their problems. People also feed black dogs, Bhairabh s animal form on Saturdays as a service to Him.",Not Available,0,Not Available

It was built in 1673 on the foundations of earlier temples that had stood here since the 15th century. The temple is a towering Newar-style pagoda with three layers of declining roofs in its physical structure. Sheet metal (possibly copper) covers the roof surfaces, which are supported by 20 struts on the first and second levels, and twelve struts on the upper level. Avalokitevara is shown in a variety of stances on each of the 52 struts, typically with one or more extra sets of arms. There are miniature vignettes depicting scenarios from Buddhist hells, such as boiling alive, on the bottom registers of the struts, beneath Avalokitevara s feet. Other vignettes are of a gentler tone, with lesser deities supporting Avalokitevara on pedestals.

This square, four-storey temple with a hip roof made of flat sheets has an air of mystery. The first recorded mention of the temple is from 1702 CE, but its true age is not known. 

Inside, the temple houses the fierce goddess Ugrachandi, the mother deity of the Tamrakar clan. Hence, this gives the temple its Newar name, Tamakahdyah which means  the goddess of Tamkrakars . According to legend, she was brought from Kathmandu to Patan through tantric magic. 

The goddess is still revered in this modern age. Despite holding its ancient religious values, many physical changes have been added to this ancient site. In 1756 and 1761 a beautiful wooden torana was added to the temple. Today, an iconic stone under a copper torana in the sanctum represents Ugrachandi exuding divine peace.

The divinity of this temple is kept alive by various rituals and worship. A Newar Upadhyaya Brahmin conducts daily rituals, supported by the Tamrakar community. Various Tamkrakar Guthi (local Newari communities) involve themselves by sponsoring different religious events at this temple.

Among these events, key activities of the shrine include the regular Ugrachandi worship. This occurs between the full moon of the month Baishakh and the sixth day of the brighter half of the month Jestha. Here also occurs the grand Tahguthi Puha with animal sacrifice and a community feast. 
These vibrant rituals and ceremonies breathe life into the temple, making it not just a structure of stone and wood but a living symbol of the Tamrakar people's faith and culture.

This sacred shrine, established during the illustrious Malla era, venerates Ganesh as one of the principal deities of the Newars. With its statue facing the west, it symbolizes an ancient connection to the spiritual and temporal realms.

The chronicles of its renovation are meticulously inscribed on the right side of the temple. You will find inscriptions recounting restorations from the years 2001 B.S. and 2033 B.S. The temple's current incarnation owes its existence to the Hasapota Ganesh Dharmik Byabasta Samiti, who rebuilt it with reverence in 2075 B.S.

A myth whispers through the ages, telling of a saint from Lhasa who meditated deeply at this site, dreaming of constructing the ""Hasapota Palace."" His untimely death left his vision unfulfilled, but his devotion transformed the place into a revered sanctuary known as ""Lhasa Hasapota."" Over time, this name evolved, giving the temple its current identity. This tale hints at a historical reverence among Buddhists, adding a rich layer to its spiritual tapestry.

Remnants of the Lichchhavi era still linger in the temple's precincts. Here idols of Nawadurga and a sacred Shiva Linga find their home. Behind the temple, an artistic Sattal structure stands as a testament to the architectural beauty of the past. On the right, a complex dedicated to religious bhajans invites devotees to lose themselves in melodic worship.

Among the many rituals and festivals celebrated here, the Dipankar Yatra stands out. The festival is primarily a part of Hiranyabarna Mahabihar. However, it weaves together the vibrant tapestry of the culture of both Hiranyabarna Mahabihar and Hasapota Ganesh Temple.

This temple, steeped in myth and history, stands as a symbol of unwavering devotion, a bridge between the past and present. It is a sacred space where the divine continues to inspire and uplift all who enter its hallowed grounds.

Its grandeur is emphasized by a singular rectangular base. Two stone lions stand guard at the entrance, symbols of strength and protection. On the western wall, a beautiful colonnaded opening and a door await those seeking divine blessings.

The temple honors Bhimsen or Bhindya?, who is revered as the deity of trade among the Newars. The temple is honored as one of Patan Durbar Square's eight treasures. Lalitpur, famed for its fine arts, houses four main Bhimsen temples. Among these Bhimsen temples, the Bhinddyolakshi temple is considered the oldest one.  Each has its own story and importance, reflecting the lasting devotion to this revered deity.  

Along with its religious significance, the temple also reflects the fine artistry of the Newars. The surface view of the temple in itself is quite grand and easy to notice. However, inside the temple. various shrines of revered deities can be found. When you enter the temple, a stone staircase ascends towards a sanctum where Bhimasena's statue stands. Nearby, statues of Draupadi, Bhairava, and Kali add vibrancy to the temple's ambiance.

Most of the temple's origin s history remains veiled in mystery. Yet, some documentation tells of its reconstruction in 1682 by Shrinivas Malla, rising from the ashes of a fierce fire. Through tremors in 1934 and 1967, it endured a lot of damage yet stood resilient. Despite the scars of the 2015 quake, its doors reopened in 2022 after reconstruction in its ancient form.

This was the capital of the ancient Sakya Kingdom, where the prince was treated to a lavish life of luxury   a way of life that he would ultimately reject to begin his spiritual journey.

When he was 29 years old, Prince Siddhartha left through the eastern gate of Kapilavastu, to start the path to enlightenment as Buddha. Today, you can stand in this exact same spot and look out through the gate, onto the green fields that saw the first steps of this epic journey. This moment has become an important part of modern spiritual journeys.

The remains of the ancient capital are in modern-day Tilaurakot and much of them have been excavated and restored, while archaeological work is still taking place to uncover even more parts of the city and insights into the life of Siddhartha Gautama.

As a major civic centre from about the 9th century BC until the 3rd century AD, there would once have been many grand buildings here. Already, experts have uncovered palace structures, temples, roads and ponds. Some of the artefacts that have been found during excavations are on display at the nearby Kapilavastu Museum.
Tilaurakot is also an important site for Hinduism and you ll notice a rustic modern Hindu temple dedicated to the deity Samai Mai within the ancient walls, where people regularly come to worship.
As you walk through the site at Tilaurakot, you ll get a sense of the scale of the city where Buddha grew up   but you ll also appreciate how isolated he was here, protected by his father. It s not hard to imagine how, as a young prince, he would have looked beyond the walls of Kapilavastu and felt there was something deeper that he needed to uncover.

His dedication to his passion has driven him to keep up with his collection and sustain the cultural heritage. The museum now showcases 655 distinct Nepali folk musical instruments among more than 1350 from all over the country. The impressive fact about this museum is that all the musical instruments are either bought or newly made by the local artisans. No instrument is taken from any place where artists still play them. Only those, which are not in use are brought and kept in the museum. That way, the local artists can continue playing live music, keeping up the vibrance of the melodies. 
Folk music is not much in practice these days, which makes it a priority to save them. If it is forgotten, it is not just the music that we lose; we lose our culture, we lose our history. The folk musical instruments are simple, made from whatever is found from the surrounding. Inspired by the sound of nature: the waterfalls, blowing of the wind, mooning of cattle, chirping of birds, even the shape of the instruments is influenced by the nature.

A pilgrimage to these three sacred spots is thought to wash away all of one’s sins and provide an opportunity to receive heavenly blessings from Lord Shiva.
Shree 1008 Jagat Guru Bheemashaankarling Shivacharya, the top priest of Kedarnath, officially designated Doleshwor Mahadev as the head of Kedarnath, one of the Char Dham Yatra, on August 22, 2009.
For the last 4,000 years, the general population was unaware of the connection between Kedarnath and Doleshwor.
Looking back at Doleshwor Mahadev’s history, it is claimed that after the Mahabharata of Kurushetra, the Pandav brothers headed for the Himalayas in seek of Lord Shiva’s pardon for the deaths of many people during the conflict.
But, because Lord Shiva was unwilling to forgive them, he disguised himself as a bull. Knowing about Lord Shiva’s disguise as the fleeing bull, the Pandavas captured the tail of the bull, at which point the head of the bull became split from the remainder of the body.
The remaining body is thought to be in Kedarnath, India’s Uttarakhand state and people have been looking for the head since then.

It might be a coincidence but yes there exist the two famous temples of Bhaktapur.
Saraswotisthan
One among them is the temple of Goddess Saraswoti and another is of the Maha Manjushree. Because of this, people seem to have a little confusion regarding the different names of the same place.
Mahamanjushree temple
Besides, Saraswotisthan and Maha Manjushree temples, that place is also called Lashapake (Lhasapako), Ratnagiri, Mahamandapgiri, and sometimes Thakalmath danda. One can witness the beautiful religious harmony over there among the Buddhist and Hindu religions.
There is not much information about the establishment of the Saraswoti temple but there is an interesting story related to the Maha Manjushree temple.
Mahamanjushree Temple
According to the chronology of Nepal, when Mahamanjushree came to Kathmandu Valley to exalt self-enlightened Swayambhu in Tretayuga, he is said to have resided in Thakalmath danda (Maha Manjushree Danda).
And, after that, he went to outlet the water of Naagdaha (serpent’s living lake) by cutting the gorges of Guheswari, Chobhar, and Katuwal with his Chandrahas Sword.
He is claimed to have settled the Kathmandu Valley after cutting the gorges. In our history books, he is also credited with founding the city of Manjupattan and erecting the throne of a monarch named Dharmakar, indicating that he was already of prehistoric importance.
Accordingly, his activities like staying and meditating at some particular place relatively have to have phenomenal importance. That’s why this place has both religious and historical importance. Besides, it delivers a great view of the Kathmandu Valley, although it is quite quashed with smoke and dust.
Mahamanjushree danda
Since the place was reverenced as Maha Manjushree’s cave, several Buddhist sages and Siddhas are believed to have visited this place. One of them was the great Poet and Buddhist master ‘Milarepa’ from the 11 – 12th century. It is believed that he visited the place at the invitation of the king from Kathmandu valley.
This is one of the important power places for Buddhist practitioners with great positive vibrations.

Again, there is one more belief that every devotee, perhaps, believes in. It is said that in the cave of Maha Manjushree (very well known as the temple of Maha Manjushree), a sound of blowing wind comes and that wind is believed to be coming from Lhasa.
Lhasa, from where Maha Manjushree, himself is believed to have come from.

Ghats are said to be an abode of ghosts, evil spirits, fierce deities, and tantric. That’s why it sounds quite scarier too.

Ghat is a Nepalese word that means the cremation area. Also, one of the features of ghats is being situated near rivers or Triveni. This, Hanuman ghat is also blessed with Triveni. Triveni generally means the confluence of three rivers. Near Hanuman ghat, a river named Bira ( streamed from Jagati), along with another river named Bhadra (running from Maheshwari) collide with the third river named Tamasa.
It is also believed that the Tamasa river does not pass from elsewhere instead the origin of this river is said to be this pilgrimage, Hanuman ghat itself.
Hanuman ghat during monsoon
Well, there is an interesting story regarding its orientation. As per which, when Lord Ram along with Sita and Hanuman was returning from the after-battle at Lanka, he paused at this place. After some rest and bath, they sat on a stone near the river and started to have fruits.
Meanwhile, Hanuman was in a jittery situation, thinking about sharing foods from the same plate as his master’s. He, in any situation, could not let his master eat the same food touched by his Jhuto hands.
(Jhuto means impure in the Nepalese language. While you are eating, your hands are assumed Jhuto until you washed them. Thus, while eating you are not allowed to enter the Kitchen, temple and another restricted area in Nepal.) 
To resolve his inner dilemma, he founded a new origin of Ganga beneath his tail which we call the Tamasa river nowadays. With the pure water of Ganga, he used to wash his hands each time he took a bite from the plate.
You can imagine, that scene must be quite hilarious. Washing hands beneath the tail that each time when you have a bite. When Lord Ram noticed this interlude, he asked Hanuman that why is he acting this weird just like a typical monkey. 
Which after, Hanuman explained all his dilemmas and deeds. Seeing Hanuman’s this devotion, lord Ram then hugged him tightly. It is said that after that incident the place was started to call Hanuman ghat though.
astamatrika at Hanuman ghat
However, people still believe that one time in a day, Hanuman appears to bathe over there. And, during that time, the way toward this ghat seems vanished or clouded.
Well, that one was an interesting story associating with Ramayan. Moreover, there is one more darn which states that the statue of Balmikeshwor Mahadev of Khorhe was erected by the Balmiki himself. Balmiki is that person who is revered as the author of Ramayana.

Dattatraya Temple
Events and festivals celebrated in Dattatraya Square
For the reason that it is situated quite far from the Bhaktapur Durbar Square, most people prefer to visit this place at least. However, being the ultimate square to be visited too, it again gives a bunch of surprises to its visitors. This square is named after the Dattatraya temple, where Dattatraya, a part of the trinity is worshipped. 
Dattatraya temple
As the other squares of Bhaktapur, this sort of place is also filled with minor and major temples. If you walk north from this temple, you’ll see a Salan Ganesh temple and behind it a giant manmade pond dedicated to Lord Ganesh. The pond is called Ganesh pokhari.
Salan Ganesh Temple and the pond
Within the area of Dattatraya Square, there are three more temples that hold both cultural and religious paramount. Among them,  this Salan Ganesh Temple has immense importance. During different festivals and events like Gai jatra, the temple is embraced by the devotees.
Salan Ganesh temple
The temple holds an image of Lord Ganesh, but, yes, it is not a sculpture. And that thing makes it quite unique from others. The image is rooted in a natural stone that has a symbolic form of Ganesha or the elephant-headed image. The Salan Ganesh is also sub-titled as the Adhi Ganesh among the asta Ganesh. Sumerialy, it dates back to 1654. 
The pond behind the Salan Ganesha Temple is said to be dedicated to the temple. That’s why it is named the Ganesha pokhari. Some people somehow also called it Yatachhen pukhu. Consequently, the eve made this pond fill with young people as well as the old ones.
Salan Ganesh pokhari
There is another temple in front of the Dattatraya temple, named after the bhimsen temple. Bhimsen is said to be the god of trade. 
Bhimsen temple and the pokhari
There are still several temples and heritage sites in Bhaktapur which has no evidence of their existence. Yet, they are standing in front of us, secreting their history somewhere else. No one accurately knows about it. In those dusting and busts, the erection of the Bhimsen temple also got faded.
Bhimsen Temple
Somehow, archaeologists presume, it was erected in 1605 CE. This two-floored rectangular pagoda locates right in front of the Dattatreya Temple. Plus, it was renovated lately, by the year 2018.
As the name of the temple assumes, it is the temple of lord Bhimsen. Bhimsen, a god with a red face, angry eyes, and a thick dark moustache. He is worshipped as the god of trade and commerce. Perhaps, because of that, every household has had its portrait, especially in the Kathmandu Valley.

With the temple, a conduit is attached, right in its back. That is a conduit but it is denoted as a pond. That’s why that conduit is called Bhimsen pokhari. Meanwhile, there are no shreds of evidence about this conduit too.
Laxmi Narayan temple
An ever-closed small temple of the premises of Dattatraya temple is the temple of Laxmi Narayan Temple. The temple is dedicated to Lord Narayan and Goddess Laxmi. The temple locates in the northern core of the square.
Laxminarayan temple
These temples had their consequences, besides these temples, two more things made this square so valuable, The woodcarving museum and the brass and bronze museum.
These museums have a large collection of woodcarvings as well as metal craftsmanship of the ancient Bhaktapur kingdom respectively.
Brass and bronze Museum
Brass and Bronze museum
The museum next to the woodcarving museum was also math. The then math, which is now representing a bunch of cases, is all related to the metalwork. And it comes under the name of Brass and Bronze Museum. However, one can enter this museum with the same ticket bought either in the National Art Gallery or the Woodcarving Museum.
The museum is filled with ancient exemplars. Just like the other museum does. But, it significantly has preserved the traditional metalworks. That includes the ceremonial lamps as well as the ritual vessels, which also make it unique from others. In some summon, it is also facing the problems of weaker lighting means.
Wood Carving Museum
Woodcarving museum
The then pujari math of Tachupal Chowk now is a more renowned museum of Bhaktapur. The wood carving museum, which originally came into existence during the reign of King Yakshya Malla. With the most epigraphic temple of Bhaktapur, The Dattatraya Temple.
After the blessing of King Yakshya Malla, it was by some means rebuilt in 1763. And again renovated by the German experts as the wedding gift to the then King Birendra in 1979.
The peacock window, being the most alluring woodcraft from the 15th century, even today made us come for it. A narrow street facing south leads to this masterpiece. However, it also had to face adversity like catching fire.
The museum, of course, with the dark rooms and brazen woodcraft showcases the then wood carvings. Nearby, there are some mini souvenir shops with miniature wooden peacock windows. And the brass and bronze museum to share the ticket, for instance. However, the earthquake of 2015 made the museum quite terrible.
But, it’s worthy enough to widen your eyes for the classics.
Peacock window
There is again one spectacular thing left behind in all these things, the very famous peacock window. You need to adopt a narrow street to reach that place, where you can slacken and peacefully adore the decorative window. Don’t get confused, it’s in the same building as a woodcarving museum.
All you need to do is get out of the museum, then head east, passing the souvenir shop just turn right. And there you go. Cheer your chin up and there is it, the world-famous peacock window.
Dattatraya Temple
Dattatraya temple is one of the oldest temples of Bhaktapur which dates back to the 14th century. And, it is the central attraction of the Square.
The temple is way more unique. Though it is the only temple of Dattatraya in Nepal, it also is acclaimed for its significant architecture. Devotees from all around the nation come and worship there.

About the Latarambeshwor Temple
Well, the architecture of the temple is recently concluded, which really is so fascinating.
It is said that it took about eighteen years to complete this structure of the temple. At first, the locals, by themselves collected the money to build the temple which later on was supported by the local government and thus this outstanding result came out.
It is an open temple, but unlike other temples that you find in Bhaktapur, it seems a little distinct. The foremost part of the temple is erected using bricks, even in those segments where normally, the wood is used like, in the windows.
The seven pinnacles and other miniature statues of Ganesha, Durga, and Saraswati on whirls of the temple give you a vibe of peacefulness and a complete shrine.

Kalamasi is a very petite agriculture-based village which by acquisitions comes under the Changunarayan Municipality. But it loves to be designated as a village that endures under the western lap of Nagarkot.
The village stays far away from the hustle and bustle of the Kathmandu Valley and is still managing its purity. There are still village settlements, agriculture, and nature, foremost. 
Within the periphery of Kalamsi, there are many more renowned sites of Bhaktapur like the Saraswati temple (the locals of Bhaktapur call it Lashapakhe ), where every year Hindu devotees come to worship Goddess Saraswati and Buddhist comes to Worship Maha Manjushri. 
Along with that, there is Muhan Pokhari, one of the finest weekend destinations which as a matter of the season, blanks out in the winter season. Yet it is quite popular among today’s generations.
In between these tranquil, there is Kalamasi, which has one of the best gifts of nature, the bojini dam and picnic spot.
Historical background of the Kalamasi lake
Bojii dam site was a small pond then and a capacious playground. According to the local people, it was a tremendous place with no use at all. There were no fields nor it was used for any other purpose. So, it used to be called Bajo Jamin. Synonymously, it means a free grassland.
Later on, Bajo Jamin transmitted it into Bojini. And came to existence as the Bojini Damsite and Picnic Spot. However, it is also titled the hidden lake of Nagarkot.
Archeologically, there is no important historical background of the destination. Besides, it was a small village before and momentarily too. But a shred of evidence and a word of the local somehow connects it with history. As per the inquiry, there used to be a grinding mill near the bojini pond. There is no exact conformity but it is said that the grinding mill was built after the then ruling queen ordered it to do so. A specific study might analyze whether it was made in the king’s ruling or Rana’s ruling era.
Furthermore, the present dam site area and the then Bojini pond was a natural swimming pool. The local people used it as a natural pool while foraging to the cows and other domestic animals.

The religious aspect of Changu
The Changu Narayan Temple, according to the evidence, is Nepal’s oldest temple, with distinctive construction and religious beliefs.
Hindus from many parts of the world frequently visit this location. Haribodhini Ekadashi, Naag Panchami, Janai Purnima, Mahashanan, Jugadi Navami, and other festivals attract them. Aside from that, the locals do their daily pujas there.
The legends
If there is a major religious site in Nepal that has no mythology associated with it, then you must be missing something. Yes, in Nepal, it is so obvious that every holy place has at least one story related to its emergence.
And this is where the story of Changu begins…
According to the legend, once a brahmin named Sudarshan traded out his cow to a cow herder (gwala). When the gwala bought her, he started to graze her in the champak forest because of the good availability of green grasses and plants over there.
He had a thought as if he fed her good grasses, she’ll honour him with a good amount of milk. But, that thing anonymously never happens to him. He continued grazing her in the forest. But, the result wasn’t satisfying for him. He always got a tiny portion of milk.
He was so disappointed, thus decided to call Brahmin Sudarshan. As soon as the gwala call him, Sudarshan gave his attendance at the gwala’s place where the gwala describes all his problems to the brahmin. Considering the words of gwala, both of them decide to go and check out the activities of the cow.
As per the planning, they followed the cow while grazing. Surprisingly, they saw a very unnatural incident. They saw a black shaded boy egressing out of an old champak tree and drinking the milk from the cow.
After observing all these things, there were sure that the boy is no human. Perhaps they think he could be the devil. That’s why they decided to cut down that tree from where he egressed and did so. But, the tree starts to bleed as they cut it.
That incident made them so anxious that they started to cry aloud and asked for forgiveness. In the meantime, Lord Vishnu or the Narayan appeared in front of them and explained everything about these incidents.
He explained that he was cursed when he accidentally murdered the Sudarshan’s father during his hunt. He was tugged over there since then. And, forthwith was freed from all his sins, because of them.
Subsequently, hearing all these things, they finally got some relief on their faces. Afterwards, they established a small temple in that arena and worshipped it as the Changu Narayan temple. Where the descendants of Sudarshan brahmin continues to become priest and descendants of the gwala continues to be guthiyars.
Things to do in Changu
As we now, know that Changu is such a complex composition of nature, culture, and modern lifestyle. Your choice of being there could make you do so many things like:
Hiking
Hiking is the best thing that Changu can offer after religious realization, of course. A one-day short hike, that you can start from Nagarkot or the Bhaktapur Durbar area. You can also choose to continue your hike to Nagarkot via telkot if you start your hike from the Nagar. The rural-urban, mixing villages, terraced fields, and jungles always welcome you on your hike. Besides the flanking breeze.

Another thing that you could prepare in Changu is cycling. There are so many turns and twists on the way of Changu road. Just like the action of the snake’s motility. Hence, anyone with an adjoining adventure nature would love this trail.

Chaling and the legend behind its name
There are a lot of perceptions about the naming of Chaling. As per one legend, in ancient time, Chaling, before being a village, there used to be a hill named Chaling Dada. From where the wave of water used to flow.  The wave of water in the Nepalese language is called “Chal”. Thus, the place from which the “Chal” is flown is then named Chaling.
Another legend says that there was a dense setup of Tamang people in Chaling and they used to bring/eat meat from Tibbet and Kavrepalanchowk but the skin of such animals was traded in the valley. In their language (In the language of Tamang people), the work of chopping and cleaning animal skin is called Chali. And, from the word, Chali the place is started to call Chaling.
Moreover, there is one more legend left. As per which, the local of that place used to cattle a lot of buffalo. But there was not a good market available for dairy products. That’s why they used to serve the cream that flows over the milk while boiling the milk to their guests.
That flowing cream in the Nepalese language is called “Tar” or the “Chali”. You could probably guess by now. Consequently, because of the Chali that the villagers used to serve and eat, the place began to call Chaling.
